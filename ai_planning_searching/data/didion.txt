In many ways, writing is the act of saying I, of imposing oneself upon other people, of saying <em>listen to me, see it my way, change your mind</em>. It’s an aggressive, even a hostile act. You can disguise its aggressiveness all you want with veils of subordinate clauses and qualifiers and tentative subjunctives, with ellipses and evasions—with the whole manner of intimating rather than claiming, of alluding rather than stating—but there’s no getting around the fact that setting words on paper is the tactic of a secret bully, an invasion, an imposition of the writer’s sensibility on the reader’s most private space.</p><div class="QpjrIaYs" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;"><div class="htlad-LH_PP_IC"></div></div>
<p>I stole the title not only because the words sounded right but because they seemed to sum up, in a no-nonsense way, all I have to tell you. Like many writers I have only this one “subject,” this one “area”: the act of writing. I can bring you no reports from any other front. I may have other interests: I am “interested,” for example, in marine biology, but I don’t flatter myself that you would come out to hear me talk about it. I am not a scholar. I am not in the least an intellectual, which is not to say that when I hear the word “intellectual” I reach for my gun, but only to say that I do not think in abstracts. During the years when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley I tried, with a kind of hopeless late-adolescent energy, to buy some temporary visa into the world of ideas, to forge for myself a mind that could deal with the abstract.</p>
<span class="pullquote">All I knew then was what I wasn’t, and it took me some years to discover what I was.</span>
<p>In short I tried to think. I failed. My attention veered inexorably back to the specific, to the tangible, to what was generally considered, by everyone I knew then and for that matter have known since, the peripheral. I would try to contemplate the Hegelian dialectic and would find myself concentrating instead on a flowering pear tree outside my window and the particular way the petals fell on my floor. I would try to read linguistic theory and would find myself wondering instead if the lights were on in the Bevatron up the hill. When I say that I was wondering if the lights were on in the Bevatron you might immediately suspect, if you deal in ideas at all, that I was registering the Bevatron as a political symbol, thinking in shorthand about the military-industrial complex and its role in the university community, but you would be wrong. I was only wondering if the lights were on in the Bevatron, and how they looked. A physical fact.</p>
<p>I had trouble graduating from Berkeley, not because of this inability to deal with ideas—I was majoring in English, and I could locate the house-and-garden imagery in<em> The Portrait of a Lady</em> as well as the next person, “imagery” being by definition the kind of specific that got my attention—but simply because I had neglected to take a course in Milton. For reasons which now sound baroque I needed a degree by the end of that summer, and the English department finally agreed, if I would come down from Sacramento every Friday and talk about the cosmology of <em>Paradise Lost</em>, to certify me proficient in Milton. I did this. Some Fridays I took the Greyhound bus, other Fridays I caught the Southern Pacific’s City of San Francisco on the last leg of its transcontinental trip. I can no longer tell you whether Milton put the sun or the earth at the center of his universe in <em>Paradise Lost</em>, the central question of at least one century and a topic about which I wrote ten thousand words that summer, but I can still recall the exact rancidity of the butter in the City of San Francisco’s dining car, and the way the tinted windows on the Greyhound bus cast the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait into a grayed and obscurely sinister light. In short my attention was always on the periphery, on what I could see and taste and touch, on the butter, and the Greyhound bus. During those years I was traveling on what I knew to be a very shaky passport, forged papers: I knew that I was no legitimate resident in any world of ideas. I knew I couldn’t think. All I knew then was what I couldn’t do. All I knew then was what I wasn’t, and it took me some years to discover what I was.</p>
<p>Which was a writer.</p>
<p>By which I mean not a “good” writer or a “bad” writer but simply a writer, a person whose most absorbed and passionate hours are spent arranging words on pieces of paper. Had my credentials been in order I would never have become a writer. Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear. Why did the oil refineries around Carquinez Strait seem sinister to me in the summer of 1956? Why have the night lights in the Bevatron burned in my mind for twenty years? <em>What is going on in these pictures in my mind?</em></p><div class="MbSbQI45" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;"><div class="htlad-LH_PP_IC"></div></div>
<span class="pullquote">Grammar is a piano I play by ear, since I seem to have been out of school the year the rules were mentioned.</span>
<p>When I talk about pictures in my mind I am talking, quite specifically, about images that shimmer around the edges. There used to be an illustration in every elementary psychology book showing a cat drawn by a patient in varying stages of schizophrenia. This cat had a shimmer around it. You could see the molecular structure breaking down at the very edges of the cat: the cat became the background and the background the cat, everything interacting, exchanging ions. People on hallucinogens describe the same perception of objects. I’m not a schizophrenic, nor do I take hallucinogens, but certain images do shimmer for me. Look hard enough, and you can’t miss the shimmer. It’s there. You can’t think too much about these pictures that shimmer. You just lie low and let them develop. You stay quiet. You don’t talk to many people and you keep your nervous system from shorting out and you try to locate the cat in the shimmer, the grammar in the picture.</p>
<p>Just as I meant “shimmer” literally I mean “grammar” literally. Grammar is a piano I play by ear, since I seem to have been out of school the year the rules were mentioned. All I know about grammar is its infinite power. To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed. Many people know about camera angles now, but not so many know about sentences. The arrangement of the words matters, and the arrangement you want can be found in the picture in your mind. The picture dictates the arrangement. The picture dictates whether this will be a sentence with or without clauses, a sentence that ends hard or a dying-fall sentence, long or short, active or passive. The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what’s going on in the picture. <em>Nota bene:</em></p>
<p>It tells you.</p>
<p>You don’t tell it.</p>
<p>Let me show you what I mean by pictures in the mind. I began <em>Play It as It Lays</em> just as I have begun each of my novels, with no notion of “character” or “plot” or even “incident.” I had only two pictures in my mind, more about which later, and a technical intention, which was to write a novel so elliptical and fast that it would be over before you noticed it, a novel so fast that it would scarcely exist on the page at all. About the pictures: the first was of white space. Empty space. This was clearly the picture that dictated the narrative intention of the book—a book in which anything that happened would happen off the page, a “white” book to which the reader would have to bring his or her own bad dreams—and yet this picture told me no “story,” suggested no situation. The second picture did. This second picture was of something actually witnessed. A young woman with long hair and a short white halter dress walks through the casino at the Riviera in Las Vegas at one in the morning. She crosses the casino alone and picks up a house telephone. I watch her because I have heard her paged, and recognize her name: she is a minor actress I see around Los Angeles from time to time, in places like Jax and once in a gynecologist’s office in the Beverly Hills Clinic, but have never met. I know nothing about her. Who is paging her? Why is she here to be paged? How exactly did she come to this? It was precisely this moment in Las Vegas that made<em> Play It as It Lays</em> begin to tell itself to me, but the moment appears in the novel only obliquely, in a chapter which begins:</p><div class="2ibyu4ev" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;"><div class="htlad-LH_PP_IC"></div></div>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">Maria made a list of things she would never do. She would never: walk through the Sands or Caesar’s alone after midnight. She would never: ball at a party, do S-M unless she wanted to, borrow furs from Abe Lipsey, deal. She would never: carry a Yorkshire in Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>That is the beginning of the chapter and that is also the end of the chapter, which may suggest what I meant by “white space.”</p>
<p>I recall having a number of pictures in my mind when I began the novel I just finished, <em>A Book of Common Prayer</em>. As a matter of fact one of these pictures was of that Bevatron I mentioned, although I would be hard put to tell you a story in which nuclear energy figures. Another was a newspaper photograph of a hijacked 707 burning on the desert in the Middle East. Another was the night view from a room in which I once spent a week with paratyphoid, a hotel room on the Colombian coast. My husband and I seemed to be on the Colombian coast representing the United States of America at a film festival (I recall invoking the name Jack Valenti a lot, as if its reiteration could make me well), and it was a bad place to have fever, not only because my indisposition offended our hosts but because every night in this hotel the generator failed. The lights went out. The elevator stopped. My husband would go to the event of the evening and make excuses for me and I would stay alone in this hotel room, in the dark. I remember standing at the window trying to call Bogotá (the telephone seemed to work on the same principle as the generator) and watching the night wind come up and wondering what I was doing eleven degrees off the equator with a fever of 103. The view from that window definitely figures in<em> A Book of Common Prayer</em>, as does the burning 707, and yet none of these pictures told me the story I needed.</p>
<span class="pullquote">When I talk about pictures in my mind I am talking, quite specifically, about images that shimmer around the edges. </span>
<p>The picture that did, the picture that shimmered and made these other images coalesce, was of the Panama airport at 6 am. I was in this airport only once, on a plane to Bogotá that stopped for an hour to refuel, but the way it looked that morning remained superimposed on everything I saw until the day I finished <em>A Book of Common Prayer</em>. I lived in that airport for several years. I can still feel the hot air when I step off the plane, can see the heat already rising off the tarmac at 6:00 a.m. I can feel the skirt damp and wrinkled on my legs. I can feel the asphalt stick to my sandals. I remember the big tail of a Pan American plane floating motionless down at the end of the tarmac. I remember the sound of a slot machine in the waiting room. I could tell you that I remember a particular woman in the airport, an American woman, a <em>norteamericana</em>, a thin <em>norteamericana</em> about forty who wore a big square emerald in lieu of a wedding ring, but there was no such woman there.</p>
<p>I put this woman in the airport later. I made this woman up, just as I later made up a country to put the airport in, and a family to run the country. This woman in the airport is neither catching a plane nor meeting one. She is ordering tea in the airport coffee shop. In fact she is not simply “ordering” tea but insisting that the water be boiled, in front of her, for twenty minutes. Why is this woman in this airport? Why is she going nowhere, where has she been? Where did she get that big emerald? What derangement, or disassociation, makes her believe that her will to see the water boiled can possibly prevail?</p><div class="tOBj603E" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;"><div class="htlad-LH_PP_IC"></div></div>
<p>She had been going to one airport or another for four months, one could see it, looking at the visas on her passport. All those airports where Charlotte Douglas’s passport had been stamped would have looked alike. Sometimes the sign on the tower would say “BIENVENIDOS” and sometimes the sign on the tower would say “BIENVENUE,” some places were wet and hot and others were dry and hot, but at each of these airports the pastel concrete walls would rust and stain and the swamp off the runway would be littered with the fuselages of cannibalized Fairchild F-227s and the water would need boiling.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">I knew why Charlotte went to the airport even if Victor did not.<br />
I knew about airports.</p>
<p>These lines appear about halfway through <em>A Book of Common Prayer</em>, but I wrote them during the second week I worked on the book, long before I had any idea where Charlotte Douglas had been or why she went to airports. Until I wrote these lines I had no character called Victor in mind: the necessity for mentioning a name, and the name Victor, occurred to me as I wrote the sentence. <em>I knew why Charlotte went to the airport </em>sounded incomplete.<em> I knew why Charlotte went to the airport even if Victor did not </em>carried a little more narrative drive. Most important of all, until I wrote these lines I did not know who “I” was, who was telling the story. I had intended until that moment that the “I” be no more than the voice of the author, a nineteenth-century omniscient narrator. But there it was:</p>
<p>“I knew why Charlotte went to the airport even if Victor did not.”</p>
<p>“I knew about airports.”</p>
<p>This “I” was the voice of no author in my house. This “I” was someone who not only knew why Charlotte went to the airport but also knew someone called Victor. Who was Victor? Who was this narrator? Why was this narrator telling me this story? Let me tell you one thing about why writers write: had I known the answer to any of these questions I would never have needed to write a novel.Some of us who live in arid parts of the world think about water with a reverence others might find excessive. The water I will draw tomorrow from my tap in Malibu is today crossing the Mojave Desert from the Colorado River, and I like to think about exactly where that water is. The water I will drink tonight in a restaurant in Hollywood is by now well down the Los Angeles Aqueduct from the Owens River, and I also think about exactly where that water is: I particularly like to imagine it as it cascades down the 45-degree stone steps that aerate Owens water after its airless passage through the mountain pipes and siphons.</p><p>As it happens my own reverence for water has always taken the form of this constant meditation upon where the water is, of an obsessive interest not in the politics of water but in the waterworks themselves, in the movement of water through aqueducts and siphons and pumps and forebays and afterbays and weirs and drains, in plumbing on the grand scale. I know the data on water projects I will never see. I know the difficulty Kaiser had closing the last two sluiceway gates on the Guri Dam in Venezuela. I keep watch on evaporation behind the Aswan in Egypt. I can put myself to sleep imagining the water dropping a thousand feet into the turbines at Churchill Falls in Labrador. If the Churchill Falls Project fails to materialize, I fall back on waterworks closer at hand -- the tailrace at Hoover on the Colorado, the surge tank in the Tehachapi Mountains that receives California Aqueduct water pumped before -- and finally I replay a morning when I was seventeen years old and caught, in a military-surplus life raft, in the construction of the Nimbus Afterbay Dam on the American River near Sacramento. I remember that at the moment it happened I was trying to open a tin of anchovies with capers. I recall the raft spinning into the narrow chute through which the river had been temporarily diverted. I recall being deliriously happy.</p><p>I suppose it was partly the memory of that delirium that led me to visit, one summer morning in Sacramento, the Operations Control Center for the California State Water Project. Actually so much water is moved around California by so many different agencies that maybe only the movers themselves know on any given day whose water is where, but to get a general picture it is necessary only to remember that Los Angeles moves some of it, San Francisco moves some of it, the Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project moves some of it and the California State Water Project moves most of the rest of it, moves a vast amount of it, moves more water farther than has ever been moved anywhere. They collect this water up in the granite keeps of the Sierra Nevada and they store roughly a trillion gallons of it behind the Oroville Dam and every morning, down at the Project's headquarters in Sacramento, they decide how much of their water they want to move the next day.</p><p>They make this morning decision according to supply and demand, which is simple in theory but rather more complicated in practice. In theory each of the Project's five field divisions -- the Oroville, the Delta, the San Luis, the San Joaquin and the Southern divisions -- places a call to headquarters before 9 AM and tells the dispatchers how much water is needed by its local water contractors, who have in turn based their morning estimates on orders from growers and other big users. A schedule is made. The gates open and close according to schedule. The water flows south and the deliveries are made. In practice this requires prodigious coordination, precision, and the best efforts of several human minds and that of a Univac 418. In practice it might be necessary to hold large flows of water for power production, or to flush out encroaching salinity in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the most ecologically sensitive point on the system.</p><p>In practice a sudden rain might obviate the need for a delivery when that delivery is already on its way. In practice what is being delivered here is an enormous volume of water, not quarts of milk or spools of thread, and it takes two days to move such a delivery down through Oroville into the Delta, which is the great pooling place for California water and has been for some years alive with electronic sensors and telemetering equipment and men blocking channels and diverting flows and shoveling fish away from the pumps. It takes perhaps another six days to move this same water down the California Aqueduct from the Delta to the Tehechapi and put it over the hill to Southern California.</p><p>"Putting some over the hill" is what they say around the Project Operations Control Center when they want to indicate that they are pumping Aqueduct water from the floor of the San Joaquin Valley up and over the Tehechapi Mountains. "Pulling it down" is what they say when they want to indicate that they are lowering a water level somewhere in the system. They can put some over the hill by remote control from this room in Sacramento with its Univac and its big board and its flashing lights. They can pull down a pool in the San Joaquin by remote control from this room in Sacramento with its locked doors and its ringing alarms and its constant print-outs of data from sensors out there in the water itself. From this room in Sacramento the whole system takes on the aspect of a perfect three-billion-dollar hydraulic toy, and in certain ways it is. "LET'S START DRAINING QUAL AT 12:00" was the 10:51 AM entry on the electronically recorded communications long the day I visited the Operations Control Center. "Quail" is a reservoir in Los Angeles County with a gross capacity of 1,636,018,000 gallons. "OK" was the response recorded in the log. I knew at that moment that I had missed the only vocation for which I had any instinctive affinity: I wanted to drain Quail myself.</p><p>Not many people I know carry their end of the conversation when I want to talk about water deliveries, even when I stress that these deliveries affect their lives, indirectly, every day. "Indirectly" is not quite enough for most people I know. This morning, however, several people I know were affected not "indirectly" but "directly" by the way water moves. They had been in New Mexico shooting a picture, one sequence of which required a river deep enough to sink a truck, the kind with a cab and a trailer and fifty or sixty wheels. It so happened that no river near the New Mexico location was running that deep this year. The production was therefore moved today to Needles, California, where the Colorado River normally runs, depending upon releases from Davis Dam, eighteen to twenty-five feet deep. Now. Follow this closely: Yesterday we had a freak tropical storm in Southern California, two inches of rain in a normally dry month, and because this rain flooded the fields and provided more irrigation than any grower could possibly want for several days, no water was ordered from Davis Dam.</p><p>No orders, no releases.</p><p>Supply and demand.</p><p>As a result the Colorado was running only seven feet deep past Needles today, Sam Peckinpah's desire for eighteen feet of water in which to sink a truck not being the kind of demand anyone at Davis Dam is geared to meet. The production closed down for the weekend. Shooting will resume Tuesday, providing some grower orders water and the agencies controlling the Colorado release it. Meanwhile many gaffers, best boys, cameramen, assistant directors, script supervisors, stunt drivers, and maybe even Sam Peckinpah are waiting out the weekend in Needles, where it is often 110 degrees at 5 PM and hard to get dinner after eight. This is a California parable, but a true one.</p><p>I have always wanted a swimming pool, and never had one. When it became generally known a year or so ago that California was suffering severe drought, many people in water-rich parts of the country seemed obscurely gratified, and made frequent reference to Californians having to brick up their swimming pools. In fact a swimming pool requires, once it has been filled and the filter has begun its process of cleaning and recirculating the water, virtually no water, but the symbolic content of swimming pools has always been interesting: a pool is misapprehended as a trapping of affluence, real or pretended, and of a kind of hedonistic attention to the body. Actually a pool is, for many of us in the West, a symbol not of affluence but of order, of control over the uncontrollable. A pool is water, made available and useful, and is, as such, infinitely soothing to the western eye.</p><p>It is easy to forget that the only natural force over which we have any control out here is water, and that only recently. In my memory California summers where characterized by the coughing in the pipes that meant the well was dry, and California winters by all-night watches on rivers about to crest, by sandbagging, by dynamite on the levees and flooding on the first floor. Even now the place is not all that hospitable to extensive settlement. As I write a fire has been burning out of control for two weeks in the ranges behind the Big Sur coast. Flash floods last night wiped out all major roads into Imperial County. I noticed this morning a hairline crack in a living-room tile from last week's earthquake, a 4.4 I never felt. In the part of California where I now live aridity is the single most prominent feature of the climate, and I am not pleased to see, this year, cactus spreading wild to the sea. There will be days this winter when the humidity will drop to ten, seven, four. Tumbleweed will blow against my house and the sound of the rattlesnake will be duplicated a hundred times a day by dried bougainvillea drifting in my driveway. The apparent ease of California life is an illusion, and those who believe the illusion real live here in only the most temporary way. I know as well as the next person that there is considerable transcendent value in a river running wild and undimmed, a river running free over granite, but I have also lived beneath such a river when it was running in flood, and gone without showers when it was running dry.</p><p>"The West begins," Bernard DeVoto wrote, "where the average annual rainfall drops below twenty inches." This is maybe the best definition of the West I have ever read, and it goes a long way toward explaining my own passion for seeing the water under control, but many people I know persist in looking for psychoanalytical implications in the passion. As a matter of fact I have explored, in an amateur way, the more obvious of these implications, and come up with nothing interesting. A certain external reality remains, and resists interpretation. The West begins where the average annual rainfall drops below twenty inches. Water is important to people who do not have it, and the same is true of control. Some fifteen years ago I tore a poem by Karl Shapiro from a magazine and pinned it on my kitchen wall. This fragment of paper is now on the wall of a sixth kitchen, and crumbles a little whenever I touch it, but I keep it there for the last stanza, which has for me the power of a prayer:</p><p align="center"><em>It is raining in California, a straight rain<br />Cleaning the heavy oranges on the bough,<br />Filling the gardens till the gardens flow,<br />Shining the olives, tiling the gleaming tile,<br />Waxing the dark camellia leaves more green,<br /></em></p><p>Flooding the daylong valleys like the Nile.</p><p>I thought of those lines almost constantly on the morning in Sacramento when I went to visit the California State Water Project Operations Control Center. If I had wanted to drain Quail at 10:51 that morning, I wanted, by early afternoon, to do a great deal more. I wanted to open and close the Clifton Court Forebay intake gate. I wanted to produce some power down at the San Luis Dam. I wanted to pick a pool at random on the Aqueduct into the Bureau of Reclamation's Cross Valley Canal, just to see how long it would take somebody over at Reclamation to call up and complain. I stayed as long as I could and watched the system work on the big board with the lighted checkpoints. The Delta salinity report was coming in on one of the teletypes behind me. The Delta tidal report was coming in on another. The earthquake board, which has been desensitized to sound its alarm -- a beeping tone for Southern California, a high-pitched tone for the north -- only for those earthquakes which register at least 3.0 on the Richter Scale, was silent. I had no further business in this room and yet I wanted to stay the day. I wanted to be the one, that day, who was shining the olives, filling the gardens, and flooding the daylong valleys like the Nile. I want it still.There is something uneasy in the Los Angeles air this afternoon, some unnatural stillness, some tension. What it means is that tonight a Santa Ana will begin to blow, a hot wind from the northeast whining down through the Cajon and San Gorgonio Passes, blowing up sand storms out along Route 66, drying the hills and the nerves to flash point. For a few days now we will see smoke back in the canyons, and hear sirens in the night. </p>    <p>I have neither heard nor read that a Santa Ana is due, but I know it, and almost everyone I have seen today knows it too. We know it because we feel it. The baby frets. The maid sulks. I rekindle a waning argument with the telephone company, then cut my losses and lie down, given over to whatever it is in the air. To live with the Santa Ana is to accept, consciously or unconsciously, a deeply mechanistic view of human behavior.</p>    <p>I recall being told, when I first moved to Los Angeles and was living on an isolated beach, that the Indians would throw themselves into the sea when the bad wind blew. I could see why. The Pacific turned ominously glossy during a Santa Ana period, and one woke in the night troubled not only by the peacocks screaming in the olive trees but by the eerie absence of surf. The heat was surreal. The sky had a yellow cast, the kind of light sometimes called "earthquake weather." My only neighbor would not come out of her house for days, and there were no lights at night, and her husband roamed the place with a machete. One day he would tell me that he had heard a trespasser, the next a rattlesnake. </p>    <p>"On nights like that," Raymond Chandler once wrote about the Santa Ana, "every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen." That was the kind of wind it was. I did not know then that there was any basis for the effect it had on all of us, but it turns out to be another of those cases in which science bears out folk wisdom. </p>    <p>The Santa Ana, which is named for one of the canyons it rushers through, is foehn wind, like the foehn of Austria and Switzerland and the hamsin of Israel. There are a number of persistent malevolent winds, perhaps the best know of which are the mistral of France and the Mediterranean sirocco, but a foehn wind has distinct characteristics: it occurs on the leeward slope of a mountain range and, although the air begins as a cold mass, it is warmed as it comes down the mountain and appears finally as a hot dry wind. Whenever and wherever foehn blows, doctors hear about headaches and nausea and allergies, about "nervousness," about "depression." </p>    <p>In Los Angeles some teachers do not attempt to conduct formal classes during a Santa Ana, because the children become unmanageable. In Switzerland the suicide rate goes up during the foehn, and in the courts of some Swiss cantons the wind is considered a mitigating circumstance for crime. Surgeons are said to watch the wind, because blood does not clot normally during a foehn. </p>    <p>A few years ago an Israeli physicist discovered that not only during such winds, but for the ten or twelve hours which precede them, the air carries an unusually high ratio of positive to negative ions. No one seems to know exactly why that should be; some talk about friction and others suggest solar disturbances. In any case the positive ions are there, and what an excess of positive ions does, in the simplest terms, is make people unhappy. One cannot get much more mechanistic than that. </p>    <p>Easterners commonly complain that there is no "weather" at all in Southern California, that the days and the seasons slip by relentlessly, numbingly bland. That is quite misleading. In fact the climate is characterized by infrequent but violent extremes: two periods of torrential subtropical rains which continue for weeks and wash out the hills and send subdivisions sliding toward the sea; about twenty scattered days a year of the Santa Ana, which, with its incendiary dryness, invariably means fire. At the first prediction of a Santa Ana, the Forest Service flies men and equipment from northern California into the southern forests, and the Los Angeles Fire Department cancels its ordinary non-firefighting routines. The Santa Ana caused Malibu to burn as it did in 1956, and Bel Air in 1961, and Santa Barbara in 1964. In the winter of 1966-67 eleven men were killed fighting a Santa Ana fire that spread through the San Gabriel Mountains.<br /> <br />Just to watch the front-page news out of Los Angeles during a Santa Ana is to get very close to what it is about the place. The longest single Santa Ana period in recent years was in 1957, and it lasted not the usual three or four days but fourteen days, from November 21 until December 4. On the first day 25,000 acres of the San Gabriel Mountains were burning, with gusts reaching 100 miles an hour. In town, the wind reached Force 12, or hurricane force, on the Beaufort Scale; oil derricks were toppled and people ordered off the downtown streets to avoid injury from flying objects. On November 22 the fire in the San Gabriels was out of control. On November 24 six people were killed in automobile accidents, and by the end of the week the Los Angeles Times was keeping a box score of traffic deaths. On November 26 a prominent Pasadena attorney, depressed about money, shot and killed his wife, their two sons and himself. On November 27 a South Gate divorcée, twenty-two, was murdered and thrown from a moving car. On November 30 the San Gabriel fire was still out of control, and the wind in town was blowing eighty miles an hour. On the first day of December four people died violently, and on the third the wind began to break. </p>    <p>It is hard for people who have not lived in Los Angeles to realize how radically the Santa Ana figures in the local imagination. The city burning is Los Angeles's deepest image of itself. Nathaniel West perceived that, in The Day of the Locust, and at the time of the 1965 Watts riots what struck the imagination most indelibly were the fires. For days one could drive the Harbor Freeway and see the city on fire, just as we had always known it would be in the end. </p>    <p>Los Angeles weather is the weather of catastrophe, of apocalypse, and, just as the reliably long and bitter winters of New England determine the way life is lived there, so the violence and the unpredictability of the Santa Ana affect the entire quality of life in Los Angeles, accentuate its impermanence, its unreliability. The winds shows us how close to the edge we are.As it happens 
        I am in Death Valley, in a room at the Enterprise Motel and Trailer 
        Park, and it is July, and it is hot. In fact it is 119. I cannot seem 
        to make the air conditioner work, but there is a small refrigerator, and 
        I can wrap ice cubes in a towel and hold them against the small of my 
        back. With the help of the ice cubes I have been trying to think, 
        because <i>The American Scholar</i> asked me to, in some abstract way 
        about morality, a word I distrust more every day, but my mind veers 
        inflexibly toward the particular.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Here are some 
        particulars. At midnight last night, on the road in from Las Vegas to 
        Death Valley Junction, a car hit a shoulder and turned over. The driver, 
        very young and apparently drunk, was killed instantly. His girl was 
        found alive but bleeding internally, deep in shock. I talked this 
        afternoon to the nurse who had driven the girl to the nearest doctor, 
        185 miles across the floor of the Valley and three ranges of lethal 
        mountain road. The nurse explained that her husband, a talc miner, had 
        stayed on the highway with the boys body until the coroner could get 
        over the mountains from Bishop, at dawn today. You cant just leave a 
        body on the highway, she said. Its immoral.</span></p>
        <p class="1Text" style="line-height: 14.0pt; text-indent: 0.15in; margin: 0 4">
        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">It was one instance 
        in which I did not distrust the word, because she meant something quite 
        specific. She meant that if a body is left alone for even a few minutes 
        on the desert, the coyotes close in and eat the flesh. Whether or not a 
        corpse is torn apart by coyotes may seem only a sentimental 
        consideration, but of course it is more: one of the promises we make to 
        one another is that we will try to retrieve our casualties, try not to 
        abandon our dead to the coyotes. If we have been taught to keep our 
        promisesif, in the simplest terms, our upbringing is good enoughwe 
        stay with the body, or have bad dreams.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">I am talking, of 
        course, about the kind of social code that is sometimes called, usually 
        pejoratively, wagon&#8209;train morality. In fact that is precisely what it 
        is. For better or worse, we are what we learned as children: my own 
        childhood was illuminated by graphic litanies of the grief awaiting 
        those who failed in their loyalties to each other. The Donner&#8209;Reed 
        Party,<b> </b>starving in the Sierra snows, all the ephemera of 
        civilization gone save that one vestigial taboo, the provision that no 
        one should eat his own blood kin. The Jayhawkers, who quarreled and 
        separated not far from where I am tonight. Some of them died in the 
        Funerals and some of them died down near Badwater and most of the rest 
        of them died in the Panamints. A woman who got through gave the Valley 
        its name. Some might say that the Jayhawkers were killed by the desert 
        summer, and the Donner Party by the mountain winter, by circumstances 
        beyond control; we were taught instead that they had somewhere abdicated 
        their responsibilities, somehow breached their primary loyalties, or 
        they would not have found themselves helpless in the mountain winter or 
        the desert summer, would not have given way to acrimony, would not have 
        deserted one another, would not have <i>failed.</i> In brief, we heard 
        such stories as cautionary tales, and they still suggest the only kind 
        of morality that seems to me to have any but the most potentially 
        mendacious meaning.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">You are quite 
        possibly impatient with me by now; I am talking, you want to say, about 
        a morality so primitive that it scarcely deserves the name, a code 
        that has as its point only survival, not the attainment of the ideal 
        good. Exactly. Particularly out here tonight, in this country so ominous 
        and terrible that to live in it is to live with antimatter, it is 
        difficult to believe that the good is a knowable quantity. Let me tell 
        you what it is like out here tonight. Stories travel at night on the 
        desert. Someone gets in his pickup and drives a couple of hundred miles 
        for a beer, and he carries news of what is happening, back wherever he 
        came from. Then he drives another hundred miles for another beer, and 
        passes along stories from the last place as well as from the one before; 
        it is a network kept alive by people whose instincts tell them that if 
        they do not keep moving at night on the desert they will lose all 
        reason. Here is a story that is going around the desert tonight: over 
        across the Nevada line, sheriffs deputies are diving in some 
        underground pools, trying to retrieve a couple of bodies known to be in 
        the hole. The widow of one of the drowned boys is over there; she is 
        eighteen, and pregnant, and is said not to leave the hole. The divers go 
        down and come up, and she just stands there and stares into the water. 
        They have been diving for ten days but have found no bottom to the 
        caves, no bodies and no trace of them, only the black 90 water going 
        down and down and down, and a single translucent fish, not classified. 
        The story tonight is that one of the divers has been hauled up 
        incoherent, out of his head, shoutinguntil they got him out of there so 
        that the widow could not hearabout water that got hotter instead of 
        cooler as he went down, about light flickering through the water, about 
        magma, about underground nuclear testing.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">That is the tone 
        stories take out here, and there are quite a few of them tonight. And it 
        is more than the stories alone. Across the road at the Faith Community 
        Church a couple of dozen old people, come here to live in trailers and 
        die in the sun, are holding a prayer sing. I cannot hear them and do not 
        want to. What I can hear are occasional coyotes and a constant chorus of 
        Baby the Rain Must Fall from the jukebox in the Snake Room next door, 
        and if I were also to hear those dying voices, those Midwestern voices 
        drawn to this lunar country for some unimaginable atavistic rites, <i>
        rock of ages cleft for me, </i>I<i> </i>think I would lose my own 
        reason. Every now and then I imagine I hear a rattlesnake, but my 
        husband says that it is a faucet, a paper rustling, the wind. Then he 
        stands by a window, and plays a flashlight over the dry wash outside.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">What does it mean? 
        It means nothing manageable. There is some sinister hysteria in the air 
        out here tonight, some hint of the monstrous perversion to which any 
        human idea can come. I followed my own conscience. I did what I 
        thought was right. How many madmen have said it and meant it? How many 
        murderers? Klaus Fuchs said it, and the men who committed the Mountain 
        Meadows Massacre said it, and Alfred Rosenberg said it. And, as we are 
        rotely and rather presumptuously reminded by those who would say it now, 
        Jesus said it. Maybe we have all said it, and maybe we have been wrong. 
        Except on that most primitive levelour loyalties to those we lovewhat 
        could be more&nbsp; arrogant than to claim the primacy of personal 
        conscience? (Tell me, a rabbi&#8209;asked Daniel Bell when he said, as a 
        child, that he did not believe in God. Do you think God cares?) At 
        least some of the time, the world appears to me as a painting by 
        Hieronymous Bosch; were I to follow my conscience then, it would lead me 
        out onto the desert with Marion Faye, out to where he stood in <i>The 
        Deer Park </i>looking east to Los Alamos and praying, as if for rain, 
        that it would happen: <i>. . . let it come and clear the rot and the 
        stench and the stink, let it come for all of everywhere, just so it 
        comes and the world stands clear in the white dead dawn. </i></span>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Of course you will 
        say that I do not have the right, even if I had the power, to inflict 
        that unreasonable conscience upon you; nor do I want you to inflict your 
        conscience, however reasonable, however enlightened, upon me. (We must 
        be aware of the dangers which lie in our most generous wishes, Lionel 
        Trilling once wrote. Some paradox of our nature leads us, when once we 
        have made our fellow men the objects of our enlightened interest, to go 
        on to make them the objects of our pity, then of our wisdom, ultimately 
        of our coercion.) That the ethic of conscience is intrinsically 
        insidious seems scarcely a revelatory point, but it is one raised with 
        increasing infrequency; even those who do raise it tend to <i>segue </i>
        with troubling readiness into the quite contradictory position that the 
        ethic of conscience is dangerous when it is wrong, and admirable when 
        it is right.</span></p>

        <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">You see I want to be 
        quite obstinate about insisting that we have no way of knowingbeyond 
        that fundamental loyalty to the social codewhat is right and what is 
        wrong, what is good and what evil. I dwell so upon this because 
        the most disturbing aspect of morality seems to me to be the frequency 
        with which the word now appears; in the press, on television, in the 
        most perfunctory kinds of conversation. Questions of straightforward 
        power (or survival) politics, questions of quite indifferent public 
        policy, questions of almost anything: they are all assigned these 
        factitious moral burdens. There is something facile going on, some 
        self&#8209;indulgence at work. Of course we would all like to believe in 
        something, like to assuage our private guilts in public causes, like to 
        lose our tiresome selves; like, perhaps, to transform the white flag of 
        defeat at home into the brave white banner of battle away from home. And 
        of course it is all right to do that; that is how, immemorially, things 
        have gotten done. But I think it is all right only so long as we do not 
        delude ourselves about what we are doing and why. It is all right only 
        so long as we remember that all the <i>ad hoc </i>committees, all the 
        picket lines, all the brave signatures in <i>The New York Times, </i>all 
        the tools of agitprop straight across the spectrum, do not confer upon 
        anyone any <i>ipso facto </i>virtue. It is all right only so long as we 
        recognize that the end may or may not be expedient, may or may not be a 
        good idea, but in any case has nothing to do with morality. Because 
        when we start deceiving ourselves into thinking not that we want 
        something or need something, not that it is a pragmatic necessity for us 
        to have it, but that it is a <i>moral imperative </i>that we have it, 
        then is when we join the fashionable madmen, and then is when the thin 
        whine of hysteria is heard in the land, and then is when we are in bad 
        trouble, And I suspect we are already there.<br>To be married in Las Vegas, Clark County’s Nevada, a bride must swear that she is eighteen or has parental permission and a bridegroom that he is twenty-one or has parental permission.

One bride out, another in, and again the sign goes up on the chapel door: &#8220;One moment please&#8211; Wedding.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I sat next to one such wedding party in a Strip restaurant last time I was in Las Vegas. The marriage had just taken place; the bride still wore her dress, the mother her corsage. A bored waiter poured out a few swallows of pink champagne (&#8220;on the house&#8221;) for everyone but the bride, who was too young to be served. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need something with more kick than that,&#8221; the bride&#8217;s father said with heavy jocularity to his new son-in-law; the ritual jokes about the wedding night had a certain Panglossian character, since the bride was <span style="background-color:#ffffff;">clearly several months pregnant. Another round of pink champagne, this time not on the house, and the bride began to cry, &#8220;It was just as nice,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;as I hoped and dreamed it would be.&#8221;</span></p>
<div>Joan Didion wrote this essay in 1967, which has since become part of classic literature.  <span style="background-color:#ffffff;">40 years later, forget about marrying absurd in Las Vegas, it is not inconceivable to see in a future not too far ahead where marrying in intself will become an absurdity.  Once created to provide an order and structure within the civilizations and then institutionalized as a ritual through religious ceremonies to make everyone practice it,  it is increasingly viewed as an archaic, sentimental and purposeless tradition.  Just as the religious institutions are being increasingly questioned with continuing human evolution, the societal practices are challenged and discarded at an even higher rate. </span></div>
<div><span style="background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Joan in the essay refers to the merchandise &#8220;niceness&#8221; provided by Las Vegas to children who do not know how else to find it, how to make the arrangements, or how to do it &#8220;right.&#8221;  While that might still be true, the reason for doing it &#8220;right&#8221; is now replaced by the disenchantment in doing it at all, without a truly clear purpose for having or wanting to go through the exercise.</span></span></div>
<div>These stats depict the clear trend of  increasing disillusionment in the institution of marriage &#8211; all over the world  (<em>courtesy of info from <a href="https://lazydabbler.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/wolframalpha-a-new-search-engine-sort-of/" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a>, I was able to search and compile this in a matter of minutes</em>):</div><blockquote><p><em>Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;<br>
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world . . .<br>
Surely some revelation is at hand;<br>
Surely the Second Coming is at hand . . .<br>
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br>
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br>
—W.B. Yeats</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The center was not holding. It was a country of bankruptcy notices and public-auction announcements and commonplace reports of casual killings and misplaced children and abandoned homes and vandals who misspelled even the four-letter words they scrawled. It was a country in which families routinely disappeared, trailing bad checks and repossession papers. Adolescents drifted from city to torn city, sloughing off both the past and the future as snakes shed their skins, children who were never taught and would never now learn the games that had held the society together. People were missing. Children were missing. Parents were missing. Those who were left behind filed desultory missing-persons reports, then moved on themselves.</p>
<p>It was not a country in open revolution. It was not a country under enemy siege. It was the United States of America in the year 1967, and the market was steady and the GNP high, and a great many articulate people seemed to have a sense of high social purpose, and it might have been a year of brave hopes and national promise, but it was not, and more and more people had the uneasy apprehension that it was not. All that seemed clear was that at some point we had aborted ourselves and butchered the job, and because nothing else seemed so relevant I decided to go to San Francisco. San Francisco was where the social hemorrhaging was showing up. San Francisco was where the missing children were gathering and calling themselves “hippies.” When I first went to San Francisco, I did not even know what I wanted to find out, and so I just stayed around awhile and made a few friends.</p>

<p>I am looking for somebody called Deadeye (all single names in this story are fictitious; full names are real), and I hear he is on the Street this afternoon doing a little business, so I keep an eye out for him and pretend to read the signs in the Psychedelic Shop on Haight Street when a kid, 16, 17, comes in and sits on the floor beside me.</p>
<p>“What are you looking for?” he says.</p>
<p>I say nothing much.</p>
<p>“I been out of my mind for three days,” he says. He tells me he’s been shooting crystal, which I pretty much know because he does not bother to keep his sleeves rolled down over the needle tracks. He came up from Los Angeles some number of weeks ago, he doesn’t remember what number, and now he’ll take off for New York, if he can find a ride. I show him a sign on the wall offering a ride to Chicago. He wonders where Chicago is. I ask where he comes from. “Here,” he says. I mean before here. “San Jose. Chula Vista, I dunno,” he says. “My mother’s in Chula Vista.”</p>
<p>A few days later I see him in Golden Gate Park. I ask if he has found a ride to New York. “I hear New York’s a bummer,” he says.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deadeye never showed up that day, and somebody says maybe I can find him at his place. It is three o’clock and Deadeye is in bed. Somebody else is asleep on the living-room couch, and a girl is sleeping on the floor beneath a poster of Allen Ginsberg, and there are a couple of girls in pajamas making instant coffee. One of the girls introduces me to the friend on the couch, who extends one arm but does not get up because he is naked. Deadeye and I have a mutual acquaintance, but he does not mention his name in front of the others. “The man you talked to,” he says, or “that man I was referring to earlier.” The man is a cop.</p>
<p>The room is overheated and the girl on the floor is sick. Deadeye says she has been sleeping for 24 hours. “Lemme ask you something,” he says. “You want some grass?” I say I have to be moving on. “You want it,” Deadeye says, “it’s yours.” Deadeye used to be a Hell’s Angel around Los Angeles, but that was a few years ago. “Right now,” he says, “I’m trying to set up this groovy religious group — ‘Teen-age Evangelism.’”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don and Max want to go out to dinner, but Don is on a macrobiotic diet so we end up in Japantown. Max is telling me how he lives free of all the old middle-class Freudian hang-ups. “I’ve had this old lady for a couple of months now, maybe she makes something special for my dinner, and I come in three days late and tell her I’ve been with some other chick, well, maybe she shouts a little but then I say, ‘That’s me, baby,’ and she laughs and says, ‘That’s you, Max. ‘“ Max says it works both ways. “I mean, if she comes in and tells me she wants to have Don, maybe, I say, ‘OK, baby, it’s your trip.’”</p>
<p>Max sees his life as a triumph over “don’ts.” The don’ts he had done before he was 21 were peyote, alcohol, mescaline, and Methedrine. He was on a Meth trip for three years in New York and Tangier before he found acid. He first tried peyote when he was in an Arkansas boys’ school and got down to the Gulf and met “an Indian kid who was doing a don’t. Then every weekend I could get loose I’d hitchhike 700 miles to Brownsville, Texas, so I could pop peyote. Peyote went for thirty cents a button down in Brownsville on the street.” Max dropped in and out of most of the schools and fashionable clinics in the eastern half of America, his standard technique for dealing with boredom being to leave. Example: Max was in a hospital in New York, and “the night nurse was a groovy spade, and in the afternoon for therapy there was a chick from Israel who was interesting, but there was nothing much to do in the morning, so I left.”</p>
<p>We drink some more green tea and talk about going up to Malakoff Diggins, a park in Nevada County, because some people are starting a commune there and Max thinks it would be a groove to take acid there. He says maybe we could go next week, or the week after, or anyway sometime before his case comes up. Almost everybody I meet in San Francisco has to go to court at some point in the middle future. I never ask why.</p>
<p>I am still interested in how Max got rid of his middle-class Freudian hang-ups, and I ask if he is now completely free.</p>
<p>“Nah,” he says. “I got acid.”</p>
<p>Max drops a 250- or 350-microgram tab every six or seven days.</p>
<p>Max and Don share a joint in the car, and we go over to North Beach to find out if Otto, who has a temporary job there, wants to go to Malakoff Diggins. Otto is trying to sell something to some electronics engineers. The engineers view our arrival with some interest, maybe, I think, because Max is wearing bells and an Indian headband. Max has a low tolerance for straight engineers and their Freudian hang-ups. “Look at ’em,” he says. “They’re always yelling ‘queer,’ and then they come prowling into the Haight-Ashbury trying to get a hippie chick.”</p>
<p>We do not get around to asking Otto about Malakoff Diggins because he wants to tell me about a 14-year-old he knows who got busted in the Park the other day. She was just walking through the Park, he says, minding her own, carrying her schoolbooks, when the cops took her in and booked her and gave her a pelvic. “<i>Fourteen years old</i>,” Otto says. “<i>A pelvic</i>.”</p>
<p>“Coming down from acid,” he adds, “that could be a real bad trip.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I call Otto the next afternoon to see if he can reach the 14-year-old. It turns out she is tied up with rehearsals for her junior-high-school play, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. “Yellow-brick-road time,” Otto says. Otto was sick all day. He thinks it was some cocaine somebody gave him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are always little girls around rock groups — the same little girls who used to hang around saxophone players, girls who live on the celebrity and power and sex a band projects when it plays — and there are three of them out here this afternoon in Sausalito where a rock group, the Grateful Dead, rehearses. They are all pretty and two of them still have baby fat and one of them dances by herself with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>I ask a couple of the girls what they do.</p>
<p>“I just kind of come out here a lot,” one of the girls says.</p>
<p>“I just sort of know the Dead,” the other says.</p>
<p>The one who just sort of knows the Dead starts cutting up a loaf of French bread on the piano bench. The boys take a break, and one of them talks about playing at the Los Angeles Cheetah, which is in the old Aragon Ballroom. “We were up there drinking beer where Lawrence Welk used to sit,” he says.</p>
<p>The little girl who was dancing by herself giggles. “Too much,” she says softly. Her eyes are still closed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Somebody said that if I was going to meet some runaways I better pick up a few hamburgers, cola, and French fries on the way, so I did, and we are eating them in the Park together, me, Debbie, who is 15, and Jeff, who is 16. Debbie and Jeff ran away 12 days ago, walked out of school one morning with $100 between them. Because a missing-juvenile is out on Debbie — she was already on probation because her mother had once taken her to the police station and declared her incorrigible — this is only the second time they have been out of a friend’s apartment since they got to San Francisco. The first time they went over to the Fairmont Hotel and rode the outside elevator, three times up and three times down. “Wow,” Jeff says, and that is all he can think of to say about that.</p>
<p>I ask why they ran away.</p>
<p>“My parents said I had to go to church,” Debbie says. “And they wouldn’t let me dress the way I wanted. In the seventh grade my skirts were longer than anybody’s — it got better in the eighth grade, but still.”</p>
<p>“Your mother was kind of a bummer,” Jeff says to her.</p>
<p>“They didn’t like Jeff. They didn’t like my girl friends. I had a C average and my father told me I couldn’t date until I raised it, and that bugged me a lot too.”</p>
<p>“My mother was just a genuine all-American bitch.” Jeff says. “She was really troublesome about hair. Also, she didn’t like boots. It was really weird.”</p>
<p>“Tell about the chores,” Debbie says.</p>
<p>“For example, I had chores. If I didn’t finish ironing my shirts for the week, I couldn’t go out for the weekend. It was weird. Wow.”</p>
<p>Debbie giggles and shakes her head. “This year’s gonna be wild.”</p>
<p>“We’re just gonna let it all happen,” Jeff says. “Everything’s in the future, you can’t pre-plan it, you know. First we get jobs, then a place to live. Then, I dunno.”</p>
<p>Jeff finishes off the French fries and gives some thought to what kind of job he could get. “I always kinda dug metal shop, welding, stuff like that.” Maybe he could work on cars, I say. “But I’m not too mechanically minded,” he says. “Anyway, you can’t pre-plan.”</p>
<p>“I could get a job baby-sitting,” Debbie says. “Or in a dime store.”</p>
<p>“You’re always talking about getting a job in a dime store,” Jeff says.</p>
<p>“That’s because I worked in a dime store already,” Debbie says.</p>
<p>Debbie is buffing her fingernails with the belt to her suede jacket. She is annoyed because she chipped a nail and because I do not have any polish remover in the car. I promise to get her to a friend’s apartment so that she can redo her manicure, but something has been bothering me, and as I fiddle with the ignition, I finally ask it. I ask them to think back to when they were children, to tell me what they had wanted to be when they were grown up, how they had seen the future then.</p>
<p>Jeff throws a cola bottle out the car window. “I can’t remember I ever thought about it,” he says. “I remember I wanted to be a veterinarian once,” Debbie says. “But now I’m more or less working in the vein of being an artist or a model or a cosmetologist. Or something.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hear quite a bit about one cop, Officer Arthur Gerrans, whose name has become a synonym for zealotry on the Street. Max is not personally wild about Officer Gerrans because Officer Gerrans took Max in after the Human Be-In last winter, that’s the big Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park where 20,000 people got turned on free, or 10,000 did, or some number did, but then Officer Gerrans has busted almost everyone in the District at one time or another. Presumably to forestall a cult of personality, Gerrans was transferred out of the District not long ago, and when I see him it is not at the Park Station but at the Central Station.</p>
<p>We are in an interrogation room, and I am interrogating Gerrans. He is young, blond, and wary and I go in slow. I wonder what he thinks the major problems in the Haight area are.</p>
<p>Officer Gerrans thinks it over. “I would say the major problems there,” he says finally, “the major problems are narcotics and juveniles. Juveniles and narcotics, those are your major problems.”</p>
<p>I write that down.</p>
<p>“Just one moment,” Officer Gerrans says, and leaves the room. When he comes back he tells me that I cannot talk to him without permission from Chief Thomas Cahill.</p>
<p>“In the meantime,” Officer Gerrans adds, pointing at the notebook in which I have written <i>major problems, juveniles, narcotics</i>, “I’ll take those notes.”</p>
<p>The next day I apply for permission to talk to Officer Gerrans and also to Chief Cahill. A few days later a sergeant returns my call.</p>
<p>“We have finally received clearance from the chief per your request,” the sergeant says, “and that is taboo.”</p>
<p>I wonder why it is taboo to talk to Officer Gerrans.</p>
<p>Officer Gerrans is involved in court cases coming to trial.</p>
<p>I wonder why it is taboo to talk to Chief Cahill.</p>
<p>The chief has pressing police business.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can talk to anyone at all in the police department.</p>
<p>“No,” the sergeant says, “not at the particular moment.”</p>
<p>Which was my last official contact with the San Francisco Police Department.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Norris and I are standing around the Panhandle, and Norris is telling me how it is all set up for a friend to take me to Big Sur. I say what I really want to do is spend a few days with Norris and his wife and the rest of the people in their house. Norris says it would be a lot easier if I’d take some acid. I say I’m unstable. Norris says, all right, anyway, <i>grass</i>, and he squeezes my hand.</p>
<p>One day Norris asks how old I am. I tell him I am 32. It takes a few minutes, but he rises to it. “Don’t worry,” he says at last. “There’s old hippies too.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a pretty nice evening, nothing much is happening and Max brings his old lady, Sharon, over to the Warehouse. The Warehouse, which is where Don and a floating number of other people live, is not actually a warehouse but the garage of a condemned hotel. The Warehouse was conceived as total theater, a continual happening, and I always feel good there. Somebody is usually doing something interesting, like working on a light show, and there are a lot of interesting things around, like an old touring car which is used as a bed and a vast American flag fluttering up in the shadows and an overstuffed chair suspended like a swing from the rafters.</p>
<p>One reason I particularly like the Warehouse is that a child named Michael is staying there now. Michael’s mother, Sue Ann, is a sweet, wan girl who is always in the kitchen cooking seaweed or baking macrobiotic bread while Michael amuses himself with joss sticks or an old tambourine or an old rocking horse. The first time I ever saw Michael was on that rocking horse, a very blond and pale and dirty child on a rocking horse with no paint. A blue theatrical spotlight was the only light in the Warehouse that afternoon, and there was Michael in it, crooning softly to the wooden horse. Michael is three years old. He is a bright child but does not yet talk.</p>
<p>On this night Michael is trying to light his joss sticks and there are the usual number of people floating through and they all drift in and sit on the bed and pass joints. Sharon is very excited when she arrives. “Don,” she cries breathlessly, “we got some STP today.” At this time STP, a hallucinogenic drug, is a pretty big deal; remember, nobody yet knew what it was and it was relatively, although just relatively, hard to come by. Sharon is blonde and scrubbed and probably 17, but Max is a little vague about that since his court case comes up in a month or so, and he doesn’t need statutory rape on top of it. Sharon’s parents were living apart when she last saw them. She does not miss school or anything much about her past, except her younger brother. “I want to turn him on,” she confided one day. “He’s 14 now, that’s the perfect age. I know where he goes to high school and someday I’ll just go get him.”</p>
<p>Time passes and I lose the thread and when I pick it up again Max seems to be talking about what a beautiful thing it is the way that Sharon washes dishes.</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> beautiful,” she says. “<i>Every</i>thing is. You watch that blue detergent blob run on the plate, watch the grease cut — well, it can be a real trip.”</p>
<p>Pretty soon now, maybe next month, maybe later, Max and Sharon plan to leave for Africa and India, where they can live off the land. “I got this little trust fund, see,” Max says, “which is useful in that it tells cops and border patrols I’m OK, but living off the land is the thing. You can get your high and get your dope in the city, OK, but we gotta get out somewhere and live organically.”</p>
<p>“Roots and things,” Sharon says, lighting a joss stick for Michael. Michael’s mother is still in the kitchen cooking seaweed. “You can eat them.”</p>

<p>Maybe eleven o’clock, we move from the Warehouse to the place where Max and Sharon live with a couple named Tom and Barbara. Sharon is pleased to get home (“I hope you got some hash joints fixed in the kitchen,” she says to Barbara by way of greeting), and everybody is pleased to show off the apartment, which has a lot of flowers and candles and paisleys. Max and Sharon and Tom and Barbara get pretty high on hash, and everyone dances a little and we do some liquid projections and set up a strobe and take turns getting a high on that. Quite late, somebody called Steve comes in with a pretty, dark girl. They have been to a meeting of people who practice a western yoga, but they do not seem to want to talk about that. They lie on the floor awhile, and then Steve stands up.</p>
<p>“Max,” he says, “I want to say one thing.”</p>
<p>“It’s your trip.” Max is edgy.</p>
<p>“I found love on acid. But I lost it. And now I’m finding it again. With nothing but grass.”</p>
<p>Max mutters that heaven and hell are both in one’s karma.</p>
<p>“That’s what bugs me about psychedelic art,” Steve says.</p>
<p>“What about psychedelic art?” Max says. “I haven’t seen much psychedelic art.”</p>
<p>Max is lying on a bed with Sharon, and Steve leans down. “Groove, baby,” he says. “You’re a groove.”</p>
<p>Steve sits down then and tells me about one summer when he was at a school of design in Rhode Island and took 30 trips, the last ones all bad. I ask why they were bad. “I could tell you it was my neuroses,” he says, “but forget it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few days later I drop by to see Steve in his apartment. He paces nervously around the room he uses as a studio and shows me some paintings. We do not seem to be getting to the point.</p>
<p>“Maybe you noticed something going on at Max’s,” he says abruptly.</p>
<p>It seems that the girl he brought, the dark, pretty one, had once been Max’s girl. She had followed him to Tangier and now to San Francisco. But Max has Sharon. “So the girl is kind of staying around here,” Steve says.</p>
<p>Steve is troubled by a lot of things. He is 23, was raised in Virginia and has the idea that California is the beginning of the end. “I feel it’s insane,” he says, and his voice drops. “This chick tells me there’s no meaning to life, but it doesn’t matter, we’ll just flow right out. There’ve been times I felt like packing up and taking off for the East Coast again. At least there I had a target. At least there you expect that it’s going to happen.” He lights a cigarette for me and his hands shake. “Here you know it’s not going to.”</p>
<p>“What is supposed to happen?” I ask.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Something. Anything.”</p>
<p>Arthur Lisch is on the telephone in his kitchen, trying to sell VISTA a program for the District. “We’ve already <i>got</i> an emergency,” he is saying into the telephone, meanwhile trying to disentangle his daughter, age one and a half, from the cord. “We don’t get help here, nobody can guarantee what’s going to happen. We’ve got people sleeping in the streets here. We’ve got people starving to death.” He pauses. “All right,” he says then, and his voice rises. “So they’re doing it by choice. So what?”</p>
<p>By the time he hangs up he has limned what strikes me as a pretty Dickensian picture of life on the edge of Golden Gate Park, but then this is my first exposure to Arthur Lisch’s “riot-on-the-Street-unless” pitch. Arthur Lisch is a kind of leader of the Diggers, who, in the official District mythology, are supposed to be a group of anonymous good guys with no thought in their collective head but to lend a helping hand. The official District mythology also has it that the Diggers have no “leaders,” but nonetheless Arthur Lisch is one. Arthur Lisch is also a paid worker for the American Friends’ Service Committee, and he lives with his wife, Jane, and their two small children in a railroad flat, which on this particular day lacks organization. For one thing, the telephone keeps ringing. Arthur promises to attend a hearing at city hall. Arthur promises to “send Edward, he’s OK.” Arthur promises to get a good group, maybe the Loading Zone, to play free for a Jewish benefit. For a second thing, the baby is crying, and she does not stop until Jane appears with a jar of Gerber’s Chicken Noodle Dinner. Another confusing element is somebody named Bob, who just sits in the living room and looks at his toes. First he looks at the toes on one foot, then at the toes on the other. I make several attempts to include Bob before I realize he is on a bad trip. Moreover, there are two people hacking up what looks like a side of beef on the kitchen floor, the idea being that when it gets hacked up, Jane Lisch can cook it for the daily Digger feed in the park.</p>
<p>Arthur Lisch does not seem to notice any of this. He just keeps talking about cybernated societies and the guaranteed annual wage and riot on the Street, unless.</p>
<p>I call the Lisches a day or so later and ask for Arthur. Jane Lisch says he’s next door taking a shower because somebody is coming down from a bad trip in their bathroom. Besides the freak-out in the bathroom, they are expecting a psychiatrist in to look at Bob. Also a doctor for Edward, who is not OK at all but has the flu. Jane says maybe I should talk to Chester Anderson. She will not give me his number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chester Anderson is a legacy of the Beat Generation, a man in his middle 30s whose peculiar hold on the District derives from his possession of a mimeograph machine, on which he prints communiqués signed “the communication company.” It is another tenet of the official District mythology that the communication company will print anything anybody has to say, but in fact Chester Anderson prints only what he writes himself, agrees with, or considers harmless or dead matter. His statements, which are left in piles and pasted on windows around Haight Street, are regarded with some apprehension in the District and with considerable interest by outsiders, who study them, like China watchers, for subtle shifts in obscure ideologies. An Anderson communiqué might be as specific as fingering someone who is said to have set up a marijuana bust, or it might be in a more general vein:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pretty little 16-year-old middle-class chick comes to the Haight to see what it’s all about and gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again and again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes &amp; raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Haight Street . . . . since the night before last. The politics and ethics of ecstasy. Rape is as common as . . . . on Haight Street. Kids are starving on the Street. Minds and bodies are being maimed as we watch, a scale model of Vietnam.</p></blockquote>
<p>Somebody other than Jane Lisch gave me an address for Chester Anderson, 443 Arguello, but 443 Arguello does not exist. I telephone the wife of the man who gave me 443 Arguello and she says it’s 742 Arguello.</p>
<p>“But don’t go up there,” she says.</p>
<p>I say I’ll telephone.</p>
<p>“There’s no number,” she says. “I can’t give it to you.”</p>
<p>“742 Arguello,” I say.</p>
<p>“No,” she says. “I don’t know. And don’t go there. And don’t use either my name or my husband’s name if you do.”</p>
<p>She is the wife of a full professor of English at San Francisco State College. I decide to lie low on the question of Chester Anderson for a while.</p>

<p>The appeal of Malakoff Diggins has kind of faded out, but Max says why don’t I come to his place, just be there, the next time he takes acid. Tom will take it too, probably Sharon, maybe Barbara. We can’t do it for six or seven days because Max and Tom are in STP space now. They are not crazy about STP, but it has advantages. “You’ve still got your forebrain.” Tom says. “I could write behind STP, but not behind acid.” This is the first time I have heard that Tom writes.</p>

<p>Otto is feeling better because he discovered it wasn’t the cocaine that made him sick. It was the chicken pox, which he caught while baby-sitting for Big Brother and the Holding Company one night when they were playing. I go over to see him and meet Vicki, who sings now and then with a group called the Jook Savages and lives at Otto’s place. Vicki dropped out of Laguna High “because I had mono,” followed the Grateful Dead up to San Francisco one time, and has been here “for a while.” Her mother and father are divorced, and she does not see her father, who works for a network in New York. A few months ago he came out to do a documentary on the District and tried to find her, but couldn’t. Later he wrote her a letter in care of her mother urging her to go back to school. Vicki guesses maybe she will go back sometime, but she doesn’t see much point in it right now.</p>

<p>We are eating a little tempura in Japantown, Chet Helms and I, and he is sharing some of his insights with me. Until a couple of years ago Chet Helms never did much besides hitchhiking, but now he runs the Avalon Ballroom and flies over the Pole to check out the London scene and says things like, “Just for the sake of clarity I’d like to categorize the aspects of primitive religion as I see it.” Right now he is talking about Marshall McLuhan and how the printed word is finished, out, over. But then he considers the <i>East Village Other</i>, an “underground” biweekly published in New York. “The <i>EVO</i> is one of the few papers in America whose books are in the black,” he says. “I know that from reading <i>Barron</i><i>’</i><i>s</i>.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A new group is supposed to play today in the Panhandle, a section of Golden Gate Park, but they are having trouble with the amplifier and I sit in the sun listening to a couple of little girls, maybe 17 years old. One of them has a lot of makeup and the other wears Levi’s and cowboy boots. The boots do not look like an affectation, they look like she came up off a ranch about two weeks ago. I wonder what she is doing here in the Panhandle, trying to make friends with a city girl who is snubbing her, but I do not wonder long, because she is homely and awkward, and I think of her going all the way through the consolidated union high school out there where she comes from, and nobody ever asking her to go into Reno on Saturday night for a drive-in movie and a beer on the riverbank, so she runs. “I know a thing about dollar bills,” she is saying now. “You get one that says ‘1111’ in one corner and ‘1111’ in another, you take it down to Dallas, Texas, and they’ll give you $15 for it.”</p>
<p>“Who will?” the city girl asks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There are only three significant pieces of data in the world today,” is another thing Chet Helms told me one night. We were at the Avalon and the big strobe was going and so were the colored lights and the Day-Glo painting, and the place was full of high-school kids trying to look turned on. The Avalon sound system projects 126 decibels at 100 feet but to Chet Helms the sound is just there, like the air, and he talks through it. “The first is,” he said, “God died last year and was obited by the press. The second is, 50 percent of the population is or will be under 25.” A boy shook a tambourine toward us and Chet smiled benevolently at him. “The third,” he said, “is that they got 20 billion irresponsible dollars to spend.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thursday comes, some Thursday, and Max and Tom and Sharon and maybe Barbara are going to take some acid. They want to drop it about three o’clock. Barbara has baked fresh bread, Max has gone to the Park for fresh flowers, and Sharon is busy making a sign for the door which reads, DO NOT DISTURB, RING, KNOCK, OR IN ANY OTHER WAY DISTURB. LOVE. This is not how I would put it to either the health inspector, who is due this week, or any of the several score of narcotics agents in the neighborhood, but I figure the sign is Sharon’s trip.</p>
<p>Once the sign is finished Sharon gets restless. “Can I at least play the new record?” she asks Max.</p>
<p>“Tom and Barbara want to save it for when we’re high.”</p>
<p>“I’m getting bored, just sitting around here.”</p>
<p>Max watches her jump up and walk out. “That’s what you call pre-acid uptight jitters,” he says.</p>
<p>Barbara is not in evidence. Tom keeps walking in and out. “All these innumerable last-minute things you have to do,” he mutters.</p>
<p>“It’s a tricky thing, acid,” Max says after a while. He is turning the stereo on and off. “When a chick takes acid, it’s all right if she’s alone, but when she’s living with somebody this edginess comes out. And if the hour-and-a-half process before you take the acid doesn’t go smooth. . . .” He picks up a marijuana butt and studies it, then adds, “They’re having a little thing back there with Barbara.”</p>
<p>Sharon and Tom walk in.</p>
<p>“You bugged too?” Max asks Sharon.</p>
<p>Sharon does not answer.</p>
<p>Max turns to Tom. “Is she all right?”</p>
<p>“Yeh.”</p>
<p>“Can we take acid?” Max is on edge.</p>
<p>“I just don’t know what she’s going to do.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>“What I want to do depends on what she wants to do.” Tom is rolling some joints, first rubbing the papers with a marijuana resin he makes himself. He takes the joints back to the bedroom, and Sharon goes with him.</p>
<p>“Something like this happens every time people take acid,” Max says. After a while he brightens and develops a theory around it. “Some people don’t like to go out of themselves, that’s the trouble. You probably wouldn’t. You’d probably like only a quarter of a tab. There’s still an ego on a quarter tab, and it wants things. Now if that thing is sex— and your old lady or your old man is off somewhere flashing and doesn’t want to be touched — well, you get put down on acid, you can be on a bummer for months.”</p>
<p>Sharon drifts in, smiling. “Barbara might take some acid, we’re all feeling better, we smoked a joint.”</p>
<p>At 3:30 that afternoon Max, Tom, and Sharon placed tabs under their tongues and sat down together in the living room to wait for the flash. Barbara stayed in the bedroom, smoking hash. During the next four hours a window banged once in Barbara’s room, and about 5:30 some children had a fight on the street. A curtain billowed in the afternoon wind. A cat scratched a beagle in Sharon’s lap. Except for the sitar music on the stereo there was no other sound or movement until 7:30, when Max said, “Wow.”</p>

<p>I spot Deadeye on Haight Street, and he gets in the car. Until we get off the Street he sits very low and inconspicuous. Deadeye wants me to meet his old lady, but first he wants to talk to me about how he got hip to helping people.</p>
<p>“Here I was, just a tough kid on a motorcycle,” he says, “and suddenly I see that young people don’t have to walk alone.” Deadeye has a clear evangelistic gaze and the reasonable rhetoric of a car salesman. He is society’s model product. I try to meet his gaze directly because he once told me he could read character in people’s eyes, particularly if he has just dropped acid, which he did about nine o’clock that morning. “They just have to remember one thing,” he says. “The Lord’s Prayer. And that can help them in more ways than one.”</p>
<p>He takes a much-folded letter from his wallet. The letter is from a little girl he helped. “My loving brother,” it begins. “I thought I’d write you a letter since I’m a part of you. Remember that: When you feel happiness, I do, when you feel . . .”</p>
<p>“What I want to do now,” Deadeye says, “is set up a house where a person of any age can come, spend a few days, talk over his problems. Any age. People your age, they’ve got problems too.”</p>
<p>I say a house will take money.</p>
<p>“I’ve found a way to make money,” Deadeye says. He hesitates only a few seconds. “I could’ve made $85 on the Street just then. See, in my pocket I had a hundred tabs of acid. I had to come up with $20 by tonight or we’re out of the house we’re in, so I knew somebody who had acid, and I knew somebody who wanted it, so I made the connection.</p>

<p>are a couple of items from Herb Caen’s column one morning as the West declined in the year 1967.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I was in San Francisco a tab, or a cap, of LSD-25 sold for three to five dollars, depending upon the seller and the district. LSD was slightly cheaper in the Haight-Ashbury than in the Fillmore, where it was used rarely, mainly as a sexual ploy, and sold by pushers of hard drugs, e.g., heroin, or “smack.” A great deal of acid was being cut with Methedrine, which is the trade name for an amphetamine, because Methedrine can simulate the flash that low-quality acid lacks. Nobody knows how much LSD is actually in a tab, but the standard trip is supposed to be 250 micrograms. Grass was running $10 a lid, $5 a matchbox. Hash was considered “a luxury item.” All the amphetamines, or “speed” — Benzedrine, Dexedrine, and particularly Methedrine (“crystal”) — were in common use. There was not only more tolerance of speed but there was a general agreement that heroin was now on the scene. Some attributed this to the presence of the Syndicate; others to a general deterioration of the scene, to the incursions of gangs and younger part-time, or “plastic,” hippies, who like the amphetamines and the illusions of action and power they give. Where Methedrine is in wide use, heroin tends to be available, because, I was told, “You can get awful damn high shooting crystal, and smack can be used to bring you down.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deadeye’s old lady, Gerry, meets us at the door of their place. She is a big, hearty girl who has always counseled at Girl Scout camps during summer vacations and was “in social welfare” at the University of Washington when she decided that she “just hadn’t done enough living” and came to San Francisco. “Actually, the heat was bad in Seattle,” she adds.</p>
<p>“The first night I got down here,” she says, “I stayed with a gal I met over at the Blue Unicorn. I looked like I’d just arrived, had a knapsack and stuff.” After that Gerry stayed at a house the Diggers were running, where she met Deadeye. “Then it took time to get my bearings, so I haven’t done much work yet.”</p>
<p>I ask Gerry what work she does. “Basically I’m a poet, but I had my guitar stolen right after I arrived, and that kind of hung up my thing.”</p>
<p>“Get your books,” Deadeye orders. “Show her your books.”</p>
<p>Gerry demurs, then goes into the bedroom and comes back with several theme books full of verse. I leaf through them but Deadeye is still talking about helping people. “Any kid that’s on speed,” he says, “I’ll try to get him off it. The only advantage to it from the kids’ point of view is that you don’t have to worry about sleeping or eating.”</p>
<p>“Or sex,” Gerry adds.</p>
<p>“That’s right. When you’re strung out on crystal you don’t need <i>nothing</i>.”</p>
<p>“It can lead to the hard stuff,” Gerry says. “Take your average Meth freak, once he’s started putting the needle in his arm, it’s not too hard to say, well, let’s shoot a little smack.”</p>
<p>All the while I am looking at Gerry’s poems. They are a very young girl’s poems, each written out in a neat hand and finished off with a curlicue. Dawns are roseate, skies silver-tinted. When she writes “crystal” in her books, she does not mean Meth.</p>
<p>“You gotta get back to your writing,” Deadeye says fondly, but Gerry ignores this. She is telling about somebody who propositioned her yesterday. “He just walked up to me on the Street, offered me $600 to go to Reno and do the thing.”</p>
<p>“You’re not the only one he approached,” Deadeye says.</p>
<p>“If some chick wants to go with him, fine,” Gerry says. “Just don’t bum my trip.” She empties the tuna-fish can we are using for an ashtray and goes over to look at a girl who is asleep on the floor. It is the same girl who was asleep on the floor the first day I came to Deadeye’s place. She has been sick a week now, 10 days. “Usually when somebody comes up to me on the Street like that,” Gerry adds, “I hit him for some change.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I saw Gerry in the Park the next day I asked her about the sick girl, and Gerry said cheerfully that she was in the hospital with pneumonia.</p>
<p>Max tells me about how he and Sharon got together. “When I saw her the first time on Haight Street, I flashed. I mean flashed. So I started some conversation with her about her beads, see, but I didn’t care about her beads.” Sharon lived in a house where a friend of Max’s lived, and the next time he saw her was when he took the friend some bananas. “Sharon and I were like kids — we smoked bananas and looked at each other and smoked more bananas and looked at each other.”</p>
<p>But Max hesitated. For one thing, he thought Sharon was his friend’s girl. “For another I didn’t know if I wanted to get hung up with an old lady.” But the next time he visited the house, Sharon was on acid.</p>
<p>“So everybody yelled, ‘Here comes the banana man,’” Sharon interrupts, “and I got all excited.”</p>
<p>“She was living in this crazy house,” Max continues. “There was this one kid, all he did was scream. His whole trip was to practice screams. It was too much.” Max still hung back from Sharon. “But then Sharon offered me a tab, and I knew.”</p>
<p>Max walked to the kitchen and back with the tab, wondering whether to take it. “And then I decided to flow with it, and that was that. Because once you drop acid with somebody, you flash on, you see the whole world melt in her eyes.”</p>
<p>“It’s stronger than anything in the world,” Sharon says.</p>
<p>“Nothing can break it up,” Max says. “As long as it lasts.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No milk today —</em><br>
<em>My love has gone away . . .</em><br>
<em>The end of my hopes —</em><br>
<em>The end of all my dreams —</em></p></blockquote>
<p>is a song I heard on many mornings in 1967 on KFRC, the Flower Power Station, San Francisco.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deadeye and Gerry tell me that they plan to be married. An Episcopal priest in the District has promised to perform the wedding in Golden Gate Park, and they will have a few rock groups there, “a real community thing.” Gerry’s brother is also getting married, in Seattle. “Kind of interesting,” Gerry muses, “because, you know, his is the traditional straight wedding, and then you have the contrast with ours.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have to wear a tie to his,” Deadeye says.</p>
<p>“Right,” Gerry says.</p>
<p>“Her parents came down to meet me, but they weren’t ready for me,” Deadeye notes philosophically.</p>
<p>“They finally gave it their blessing,” Gerry says. “In a way.”</p>
<p>“They came to me and her father said, ‘Take care of her,’ “Deadeye reminisces. “And her mother said, ‘Don’t let her go to jail.’”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Barbara has baked a macrobiotic apple pie — one made without sweets and with whole-wheat flour — and she and Tom and Max and Sharon and I are eating it. Barbara tells me how she learned to find happiness in “the woman’s thing.” She and Tom had gone somewhere to live with the Indians, and although she first found it hard to be shunted off with the women and never to enter into any of the men’s talk, she soon got the point. “That was where the <i>trip</i> was,” she says.</p>
<p>Barbara is on what is called the woman’s trip to the exclusion of almost everything else. When she and Tom and Max and Sharon need money, Barbara will take a part-time job, modeling or teaching kindergarten, but she dislikes earning more than $10 or $20 a week. Most of the time she keeps house and bakes. “Doing something that shows your love that way,” she says, “is just about the most beautiful thing I know.” Whenever I hear about the woman’s trip, which is often, I think a lot about nothin’-says-lovin’-like-something-from-the-oven and the <i>Feminine Mystique</i> and how it is possible for people to be the unconscious instruments of values they would strenuously reject on a conscious level, but I do not mention this to Barbara.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a pretty nice day and I am just driving down the Street and I see Barbara at a light.</p>
<p>What am I doing, she wants to know.</p>
<p>I am just driving around.</p>
<p>“Groovy,” she says.</p>
<p>This is quite a beautiful day, I say.</p>
<p>“Groovy,” she agrees.</p>
<p>She wants to know if I will come over. Sometime soon, I say.</p>
<p>“Groovy,” she says.</p>
<p>I ask if she wants to drive in the Park but she is too busy. She is out to buy wool for her loom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arthur Lisch gets pretty nervous whenever he sees me now because the Digger line this week is that they aren’t talking to “media poisoners,” which is me. So I still don’t have a tap on Chester Anderson, but one day in the Panhandle I run into a kid who says he is Chester’s “associate.” He has on a black cape, black slouch hat, mauve Job’s Daughters’ sweatshirt and dark glasses, and he says his name is Claude Hayward, but never mind that because I think of him just as The Connection. The Connection offers to “check me out.”</p>
<p>I take off my dark glasses so he can see my eyes. He leaves his on.</p>
<p>“How much you get paid for doing this kind of media poisoning?” he says for openers.</p>
<p>I put my dark glasses back on.</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to find out where it’s at,” The Connection says, and jerks his thumb at the photographer I’m with. “Dump him and get out on the Street. Don’t take money. You won’t need money.” He reaches into his cape and pulls out a mimeographed sheet announcing a series of classes at the Digger Free Store on How to Avoid Getting Busted, VD, Rape, Pregnancy, Beatings and Starvation. “You oughta come,” The Connection says. “You’ll need it.”</p>
<p>I say maybe, but meanwhile I would like to talk to Chester Anderson.</p>
<p>“If we decide to get in touch with you at all,” The Connection says, “we’ll get in touch with you real quick.” He kept an eye on me in the Park after that, but he never did call the number I gave him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is twilight and cold and too early to find Deadeye at the Blue Unicorn so I ring Max’s bell. Barbara comes to the door.</p>
<p>“Max and Tom are seeing somebody on a kind of business thing,” she says. “Can you come back a little later?” I am hard put to think what Max and Tom might be seeing somebody about in the way of business, but a few days later in the Park I find out.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Tom calls. “Sorry you couldn’t come up the other day, but <i>business</i> was being done.” This time I get the point. “We got some great stuff,” he adds, and begins to elaborate. Every third person in the Park this afternoon looks like a narcotics agent and I try to change the subject. Later I suggest to Max that he be more wary in public. “Listen, I’m very cautious,” he says. “You can’t be too careful.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By now I have an unofficial taboo contact with the San Francisco Police Department. What happens is that this cop and I meet in various late-movie ways, like I happen to be sitting in the bleachers at a baseball game and he happens to sit down next to me, and we exchange guarded generalities. No information actually passes between us, but after a while we get to kind of like each other.</p>
<p>“The kids aren’t too bright,” he is telling me on this particular day. “They’ll tell you they can always spot an undercover, they’ll tell you about ‘the kind of car he drives.’ They aren’t talking about undercovers, they’re talking about plainclothesmen who just happen to drive unmarked cars, like I do. They can’t tell an undercover. An undercover doesn’t drive some black Ford with a two-way radio.”</p>
<p>He tells me about an undercover who was taken out of the District because he was believed to be over-exposed, too familiar. He was transferred to the narcotics squad, and by error was immediately sent back into the District as a narcotics undercover.</p>
<p>The cop plays with his keys. “You want to know how smart these kids are?” he says finally. “The first week, this guy makes 43 cases.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some kid with braces on his teeth is playing his guitar and boasting that he got the last of the STP from Mr. X himself, and someone else is talking about some acid that will be available within the next month, and you can see that nothing much is happening around the San Francisco Oracle office this afternoon. A boy sits at a drawing board drawing the infinitesimal figures that people do on speed, and the kid with the braces watches him. “<i>I</i><i>’</i><i>m </i><i>gonna</i><i> shoot my wo</i><i>–</i><i>man</i>,” he sings softly. “<i>She been with a–</i><i>noth</i><i>–</i><i>er</i><i> man</i>.” Someone works out the numerology of my name and the name of the photographer I’m with. The photographer’s is all white and the sea (“If I were to make you some beads, see, I’d do it mainly in white,” he is told), but mine has a double death symbol. The afternoon does not seem to be getting anywhere, so it’s suggested we get in touch with a man named Sandy. We are told he will take us to the Zen temple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Four boys and one middle-aged man are sitting on a grass mat at Sandy’s place, sipping anise tea and listening to Sandy read Laura Huxley’s <i>You Are Not the Target</i>.</p>
<p>We sit down and have some anise tea. “Meditation turns us on,” Sandy says. He has a shaved head and the kind of cherubic face usually seen in newspaper photographs of mass murderers. The middle-aged man, whose name is George, is making me uneasy because he is in a trance next to me and he stares at me without seeing me.</p>
<p>I feel that my mind is going — George is <i>dead</i>, or we <i>all</i> are — when the telephone suddenly rings.</p>
<p>“It’s for George,” Sandy says.</p>
<p>“George, <i>tele</i>phone.”</p>
<p>“<i>George</i>.”</p>
<p>Somebody waves his hand in front of George and George finally gets up, bows, and moves toward the door on the balls of his feet.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll take George’s tea,” somebody says. “George — are you coming back?”</p>
<p>George stops at the door and stares at each of us in turn. “In a <i>mo</i>ment,” he snaps.</p>

<p>is a Krishna song. Words by Howard Wheeler and music by Michael Grant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe the trip is not in Zen but in Krishna, so I visit Michael Grant, the Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta’s leading disciple in San Francisco. Grant is at home with his brother-in-law and his wife, a pretty girl wearing a cashmere pullover, a jumper and a red caste mark on her forehead.</p>
<p>“I’ve been associated with the Swami since about last July,” Michael says. “See, the Swami came here from India, and he was at this ashram (hermitage) in upstate New York and he just kept to himself and chanted a lot. For a couple of months, pretty soon I helped him get his storefront in New York. Now it’s an international movement, which we spread by teaching this chant.” Michael is fingering his red wooden beads, and I notice that I am the only person in the room who is wearing shoes. “It’s catching on like wildfire.”</p>
<p>“If everybody chanted,” the brother-in-law says, “there wouldn’t be any problem with the police or anybody.”</p>
<p>“Ginsberg calls the chant ecstasy, but the Swami says that’s not exactly it.” Michael walks across the room and straightens a picture of Krishna as a baby. “Too bad you can’t meet the Swami,” he adds. “The Swami’s in New York now.”</p>
<p>“Ecstasy’s not the right word at all,” says the brother-in-law, who has been thinking about it. “It makes you think of some mun<i>dane</i> ecstasy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next day I drop by Max and Sharon’s, and find them in bed smoking a little morning hash. Sharon once advised me that even half a joint of grass would make getting up in the morning a beautiful thing. I ask Max how Krishna strikes him.</p>
<p>“You can get a high on a mantra,” he says. “But I’m holy on acid.”</p>
<p>Max passes the joint to Sharon and leans back. “Too bad you couldn’t meet the Swami,” he says. “The Swami was the turn-on.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Anybody who thinks this is all about drugs has his head in a bag. It’s a social movement, quintessentially romantic, the kind that recurs in times of real social crisis. The themes are always the same. A return to innocence. The invocation of an earlier authority and control. The mysteries of the blood. An itch for the transcendental, for purification. Right there you’ve got the ways that romanticism historically ends up in trouble, lends itself to authoritarianism. When the direction appears. How long do you think it’ll take for that to happen?”</em></p>
<p>is a question a San Francisco psychiatrist asked me.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, I was in San Francisco, the political potential of the movement was just becoming clear. It had always been clear to the revolutionary core of the Diggers, whose guerrilla talent was now bent on open confrontations and the creation of a summer emergency, and it was clear to many of the doctors and priests and sociologists who had occasion to work in the District, and it could rapidly become clear to any outsider who bothered to decode Chester Anderson’s call-to-action communiqués or to watch who was there first at the street skirmishes which now set the tone for life in the District. One did not have to be a political analyst to see it: The boys in the rock groups saw it, because they were often where it was happening. “In the Park there are always twenty or thirty people below the stand,” one of the Grateful Dead complained to me, “ready to take the crowd on some militant trip.”</p>
<p>But the peculiar beauty of this political potential, as far as the activists were concerned, was that it remained not clear at all to most of the inhabitants of the District. Nor was it clear to the press, which at varying levels of competence continued to report “the hippie phenomenon” as an extended panty raid; an artistic avant-garde led by such comfortable YMHA regulars as Allen Ginsberg; or a thoughtful protest, not unlike joining the Peace Corps.</p>
<p>This last, or they’re-trying-to-tell-us-something approach, reached its apogee in July in a <i>Time</i> cover story which revealed that hippies “scorn money — they call it ‘bread,’” and remains the most remarkable, if unwitting, extant evidence that the signals between the generations are irrevocably jammed.</p>
<p>Because the signals the press was getting were immaculate of political possibilities, the tensions of the District went unremarked upon, even during the period when there were so many observers on Haight Street from <i>Life</i> and <i>Look</i> and CBS that they were largely observing one another. The observers believed roughly what the children told them: That they were a generation dropped out of political action, beyond power games, that the New Left was on an ego trip. <i>Ergo</i>, there really were no activists in the Haight-Ashbury, and those things which happened every Sunday were spontaneous demonstrations because, just as the Diggers say, the police are brutal and juveniles have no rights and runaways are deprived of their right to self-determination, and people are starving to death on Haight Street.</p>
<p>Of course the activists — not those whose thinking had become rigid, but those whose approach to revolution was imaginatively anarchic — had long ago grasped the reality which still eluded the press: We were seeing something important. We were seeing the desperate attempt of a handful of pathetically unequipped children to create a community in a social vacuum. Once we had seen these children, we could no longer overlook the vacuum, no longer pretend that the society’s atomization could be reversed. At some point between 1945 and 1967, we had somehow neglected to tell these children the rules of the game we happened to be playing. Maybe we had stopped believing in the rules ourselves, maybe we were having a failure of nerve about the game. Or maybe there were just too few people around to do the telling. These were children who grew up cut loose from the web of cousins and great-aunts and family doctors and lifelong neighbors who had traditionally suggested and enforced the society’s values. They are children who have moved around a lot, <i>San Jose, Chula Vista, here</i>. They are less in rebellion against the society than ignorant of it, able only to feed back certain of its most publicized self-doubts, <i>Vietnam, diet pills, the Bomb</i>.</p>
<p>They feed back exactly what is given them. Because they do not believe in words — words are for “typeheads,” Chester Anderson tells them, and a thought which needs words is just another ego trip — their only proficient vocabulary is in the society’s platitudes. As it happens, I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for oneself depends upon one’s mastery of the language, and I am not optimistic about children who will settle for saying, to indicate that their mother and father do not live together, that they come from “a broken home.” They are 14, 15, 16 years old, younger all the time, an army of children waiting to be given the words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peter Berg knows a lot of words.</p>
<p>“Is Peter Berg around?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>“Are you Peter Berg?”</p>
<p>“Yeh.”</p>
<p>The reason Peter Berg does not bother to share too many words with me is because two of the words he knows are “media poisoning.” Peter Berg wears a gold earring and is perhaps the only person in the District upon whom a gold earring looks obscurely ominous. He belongs to the San Francisco Mime Troupe, some of whose members started the Artist’s Liberation Front for “those who seek to combine their creative urge with socio-political involvement.” It was out of the Mime Troupe that the Diggers grew, during the 1966 Hunter’s Point riots when it seemed a good idea to give away food and do puppet shows in the streets, making fun of the National Guard. Along with Arthur Lisch, Peter Berg is part of the shadow leadership of the Diggers, and it was he who more or less invented and first introduced to the press the notion that there would be an influx into San Francisco this summer of 200,000 indigent adolescents. The only conversation I ever have with Peter Berg is about how he holds me personally responsible for the way <em>Life</em> captioned Henri Cartier-Bresson’s pictures out of Cuba, but I like to watch him at work in the Park.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Big Brother is playing in the Panhandle, and almost everybody is high, and it is a pretty nice Sunday afternoon between three and six o’clock, which the activists say are the three hours of the week when something is most likely to happen in the Haight-Ashbury, and who turns up but Peter Berg. He is with his wife and six or seven other people, along with Chester Anderson’s associate The Connection, and the first peculiar thing is, they’re in blackface. I mention to Max and Sharon that some members of the Mime Troupe seem to be in blackface.</p>
<p>“It’s street theater,” Sharon assures me. “It’s supposed to be really groovy.”</p>
<p>The Mime Troupers get a little closer, and there are some other peculiar things about them. For one thing they are tapping people on the head with dimestore plastic nightsticks, and for another they are wearing signs on their backs: HOW MANY TIMES YOU BEEN RAPED, YOU LOVE FREAKS? and things like that. Then they are distributing communication-company fliers which say:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>&amp; this summer thousands of unwhite un–suburban boppers are going to want to know why you’ve given up what they can’t get &amp; how you get away with it &amp; how come you not a faggot with hair so long &amp; they want haight street one way or the other. IF YOU DON’T KNOW, BY AUGUST HAIGHT STREET WILL BE A CEMETERY.</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Max reads the flier and stands up. “I’m getting bad vibes,” he says, and he and Sharon leave.</p>
<p>I have to stay around because I’m looking for Otto so I walk over to where the Mime Troupers have formed a circle around a Negro. Peter Berg is saying, if anybody asks, that this is street theater, and I figure the curtain is up because what they are doing right now is jabbing the Negro with the nightsticks. They jab, and they bare their teeth, and they rock on the balls of their feet, and they wait.</p>
<p>“I’m beginning to get annoyed here,” the Negro says. “I’m gonna get mad.” By now there are several Negroes around, reading the signs and watching.</p>
<p>“Just beginning to get annoyed, are you?” one of the Mime Troupers says. “Don’t you think it’s about time?”</p>
<p>“Listen, here,” another Negro says. “There’s room for everybody in the Park.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” a girl in blackface says. “Everybody <i>who</i>?”</p>
<p>“Why,” he says, confused. “Everybody. In America.”</p>
<p>“In <i>America</i>,”the blackface girl shrieks. “Listen to him talk about America.”</p>
<p>“Listen,” he says. “Listen here.”</p>
<p>“What’d <i>America</i> ever do for you?” the girl in blackface jeers. “White kids here, they can sit in the Park all summer long, listening to music, because their big-shot parents keep sending them money. Who ever sends you money?”</p>
<p>“Listen,” the Negro says helplessly. “You’re gonna start something here, this isn’t right —”</p>
<p>“You tell us what’s right, black boy,” the girl says.</p>
<p>The youngest member of the blackface group, an earnest tall kid about 19, 20, is hanging back at the edge of the scene. I offer him an apple and ask what is going on. “Well,” he says, “I’m new at this, I’m just beginning to study it, but you see the capitalists are taking over the District, and that’s what Peter — well, ask Peter.”</p>
<p>I did not ask Peter. It went on for a while. But on that particular Sunday between three and six o’clock everyone was too high, and the weather was too good, and the Hunter’s Point gangs who usually come in between three and six on Sunday afternoon had come in on Saturday instead, and nothing started. While I waited for Otto I asked a little girl I had met a couple of times before what she had thought of it. “It’s something groovy they call street theater,” she said. I said I had wondered if it might not have political overtones. She is 17 years old, and she worked it around in her mind for a while and finally she remembered a couple of words from somewhere. “Maybe it’s some John Birch thing,” she said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I finally find Otto he says, “I got something at my place that’ll blow your mind,” and when we get there I see a child on the living-room floor, wearing a reefer coat, reading a comic book. She keeps licking her lips in concentration and the only off thing about her is that she’s wearing white lipstick.</p>
<p>“Five years old,” he says. “On acid.”</p>
<p>The five-year-old’s name is Susan, and she tells me she is in High Kindergarten. She lives with her mother and some other people, just got over the measles, wants a bicycle for Christmas, and particularly likes soda, ice cream, Marty in the Jefferson Airplane, Bob in the Grateful Dead, and the beach. She remembers going to the beach once a long time ago, and wishes she had taken a bucket. For a year, her mother has given her acid and peyote. Susan describes it as getting stoned.</p>
<p>I start to ask if any of the other children in High Kindergarten get stoned, but I falter at the key words.</p>
<p>“She means do the other kids in your class turn on, <i>get stoned</i>,” says the friend of her mothers who brought her to Otto’s.</p>
<p>“Only Sally and Anne,” Susan says.</p>
<p>“What about Lia?” her mother’s friend prompts.</p>
<p>“Lia,” Susan says, “is not in High Kindergarten.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sue Ann’s three-year-old Michael started a fire this morning before anyone was up, but Don got it out before much damage was done. Michael burned his arm, though, which is probably why his mother was so jumpy when she happened to see him chewing on an electric cord. “You’ll fry like rice,” she screamed. The only people around were Don and one of Sue Ann’s macrobiotic friends and somebody who was on his way to a commune in the Santa Lucias, and they didn’t notice Sue Ann screaming at Michael because they were in the kitchen trying to retrieve some very good Moroccan hash which had dropped down through a floorboard that had been damaged in the fire.GOODBYE TO ALL THAT                                           by Joan Didion<br />

It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends. I can remember now, with a clarity that makes the nerves in the back of my neck constrict, when New York began for me, but I cannot lay my  finger upon the moment it ended, can never cut through the ambiguities and second starts and broken resolves to the exact place on the page where the heroine is no longer as optimistic as she once was. When I first saw New York I was twenty, and it was summertime, and I got off a DC-7 at the old Idlewild temporary terminal in a new dress which had seemed very smart in Sacramento but seemed less smart already, even in  the old Idlewild temporary terminal, and the warm air smelled of mildew and some instinct, programmed by all the movies I had ever seen and all the songs I had ever read about New York, informed me that it would never be quite the same again. In fact it never was. Some time later there was a song in the jukeboxes on the Upper East Side that went &#8220;but where is the schoolgirl who used to be me,&#8221; and if it was late enough at night I used to wonder that. I know now that almost everyone wonders something like that, sooner or later and no matter what he or she is doing, but one of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before.<br />
<br />
Of course it might have been some other city, had circumstances been different and the time been different and had I been different, might have been Paris or Chicago or even San Francisco, but because I am talking about myself I am talking here about New York. That first night I opened my window on the bus into town and watched for the skyline, but all I could see were the wastes of Queens and big signs that said MIDTOWN TUNNEL THIS LANE and then a flood of summer rain (even that seemed remarkable and exotic, for I had come out of the West where there was no summer rain), and for the next three days I sat wrapped in blankets in a hotel room air conditioned to 35 degrees and tried to get over a cold and a high fever. It did not occur to me to call a doctor, because I knew none, and although it did occur to me to call the desk and ask that the air conditioner be turned off, I never called, because I did not know how much to tip whoever might come&#8212;was anyone ever so young? I am here to tell you that someone was. All I could do during those years was talk long-distance to the boy I already knew I would never marry in the spring. I would stay in New York, I told him, just six months, and I could see the Brooklyn Bridge from my window. As it turned out the bridge was the Triborough, and I stayed eight years.<br />
<br />
<a name='more'></a>In retrospect it seems to me that those days before I knew the names of all the bridges were happier than the ones that came later, but perhaps you will see that as we go along. Part of what I want to tell you is what it is like to be young in New York, how six months can become eight years with the deceptive ease of a film dissolve, for that is how those years appear to me now, in a long sequence of sentimental dissolves and old-fashioned trick shots&#8212;the Seagram Building fountains dissolve into snowflakes, I enter a revolving door at twenty and come out a good deal older, and on a different street. But most particularly I want to explain to you, and in the process perhaps to myself, why I no longer live in New York. It is often said that New York is a city for only the very rich and the very poor. It is less often said that New York is also, at least for those of us who came there from somewhere else, a city only for the very young.<br />
<br />
I remember once, one cold bright December evening in New York, suggesting a friend who complained of having been around too long that he come with me to a party where there would be, I assured him with the bright resourcefulness of twenty-three, &#8220;new faces.&#8221; He laughed literally until he choked, and I had to roll down the taxi window and hit him on the back. &#8220;New faces,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;don&#8217;t tell me about new faces.&#8221; It seemed that the last time he had gone to a party where he had been promised &#8220;new faces,&#8221; there had been fifteen people in the room, and he had already spelt with five of the women and owed money to all but two of the men. I laughed with him, but the first snow had just begun to fall and the big Christmas trees glittered yellow and white as far as I could see up Park Avenue and I had a new dress and it would be a long while before I would come to understand the particular moral of the story.<br />
<br />
It would be a long while because, quite simply, I was in love with New York. I do not mean &#8220;love&#8221; in any colloquial way, I mean that I was in love with the city, the way you love the first person who ever touches you and you never love anyone quite that way again. I remember walking across Sixty-second Street one twilight that first spring, or the second spring, they were all alike for a while. I was late to meet someone but I stopped at Lexington Avenue and bought a peach and stood on the corner eating it and knew that I had come out out of the West and reached the mirage. I could taste the peach and feel the soft air blowing from a subway grating on my legs and I could smell lilac and garbage and expensive perfume and I knew that it would cost something sooner or later&#8212;because I did not belong there, did not come from there&#8212;but when you are twenty-two or twenty-three, you figure that later you will have a high emotional balance, and be able to pay whatever it costs. I still believed in possibilities then, still had the sense, so peculiar to New York, that something extraordinary would happen any minute, any day, any month. I was making only $65 or $70 then a week then (&#8220;Put yourself in Hattie Carnegie&#8217;s hands,&#8221; I was advised without the slightest trace of irony by an editor of the magazine for which I worked), so little money that some weeks I had to charge food at Bloomingdale&#8217;s gourmet shop in order to eat, a fact which went unmentioned in the letters I wrote to California. I never told my father that I needed money because then he would have sent it, and I would never know if I could do it by myself. At that time making a living seemed a game to me, with arbitrary but quite inflexible rules. And except on a certain kind of winter evening&#8212;six-thirty in the Seventies, say, already dark and bitter with a wind off the river, when I would be walking very fast toward a bus and would look in the bright windows of brownstones and see cooks working in clean kitchens and and imagine women lighting candles on the floor above and beautiful children being bathed on the floor above that&#8212;except on nights like those, I never felt poor; I had the feeling that if I needed money I could always get it. I could write a syndicated column for teenagers under the name &#8220;Debbi Lynn&#8221; or I could smuggle gold into India or I could become a $100 call girl, and none of would matter.<br />
<br />
Nothing was irrevocable; everything was within reach. Just around every corner lay something curious and interesting, something I had never before seen or done or known about. I could go to a party and meet someone who called himself Mr. Emotional Appeal and ran The Emotional Appeal Institute or Tina Onassis Blandford or a Florida cracker who was then a regular on what the called &#8220;the Big C,&#8221; the Southampton-El Morocco circuit (&#8220;I&#8217;m well connected on the Big C, honey,&#8221; he would tell me over collard greens on his vast borrowed terrace), or the widow of the celery king of the Harlem market or a piano salesman from Bonne Terre, Missouri, or someone who had already made and list two fortunes in Midland, Texas. I could make promises to myself and to other people and there would be all the time in the world to keep them. I could stay up all night and make mistakes, and none of them would count.<br />
<br />
You see I was in a curious position in New York: it never occurred to me that I was living a real life there. In my imagination I was always there for just another few months, just until Christmas or Easter or the first warm day in May. For that reason I was most comfortable with the company of Southerners. They seemed to be in New York as I was, on some indefinitely extended leave from wherever they belonged, disciplined to consider the future, temporary exiles who always knew when the flights left for New Orleans or Memphis or Richmond or, in my case, California. Someone who lives with a plane schedule in the drawer lives on a slightly different calendar. Christmas, for example, was a difficult season. Other people could take it in stride, going to Stowe or going abroad or going for the day to their mothers&#8217; places in Connecticut; those of us who believed that we lived somewhere else would spend it making and canceling airline reservations, waiting for weatherbound flights as if for the last plane out of Lisbon in 1940, and finally comforting one another, those of us who were left, with oranges and mementos and smoked-oyster stuffings of childhood, gathering close, colonials in a far country.<br />
<br />
Which is precisely what we were. I am not sure that it is possible for anyone brought up in the East to appreciate entirely what New York, the idea of New York, means to those of us who came out of the West and the South. To an Eastern child, particularly a child who has always has an uncle on Wall Street and who has spent several hundred Saturdays first at F.A.O. Schwarz and being fitted for shoes at Best&#8217;s and then waiting under the Biltmore clock and dancing to Lester Lanin, New York is just a city, albeit the city, a plausible place for people to live, But to those of us who came from places where no one had heard of Lester Lanin and Grand Central Station was a Saturday radio program, where Wall Street and Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue were not places at all but abstractions (&#8220;Money,&#8221; and &#8220;High Fashion,&#8221; and &#8220;The Hucksters&#8221;), New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself. To think of &#8220;living&#8221; there was to reduce the miraculous to the mundane; one does not &#8220;live&#8221; at Xanadu.<br />
<br />
In fact it was difficult in the extreme for me to understand those young women for whom New York was not simply an ephemeral Estoril but a real place, girls who bought toasters and installed new cabinets in their apartments and committed themselves to some reasonable furniture. I never bought any furniture in New York. For a year or so I lived in other people&#8217;s apartments; after that I lived in the Nineties in an apartment furnished entirely with things taken from storage by a friend whose wife had moved away. And when I left the apartment in the Nineties (that was when I was leaving everything, when it was all breaking up) I left everything in it, even my winter clothes and the map of Sacramento County I had hung on the bedroom wall to remind me who I was, and I moved into a monastic four-room floor-through on Seventy-fifth Street. &#8220;Monastic&#8221; is perhaps misleading here, implying some chic severity; until after I was married and my husband moved some furniture in, there was nothing at all in those four rooms except a cheap double mattress and box springs, ordered by telephone the day I decided to move, and two French garden chairs lent me by a friend who imported them. (It strikes me now that the people I knew in New York all had curious and self-defeating sidelines. They imported garden chairs which did not sell very well at Hammacher Schlemmer or they tried to market hair staighteners in Harlem or they ghosted exposés of Murder Incorporated for Sunday supplements. I think that perhaps none of us was very serious, engagé only about our most private lives.)<br />
<br />
All I ever did to that apartment was hang fifty yards of yellow theatrical silk across the bedroom windows, because I had some idea that the gold light would make me feel better, but I did not bother to weight the curtains correctly and all that summer the long panels of transparent golden silk would blow out  the windows and get tangled and drenched in afternoon thunderstorms. That was the year, my twenty-eight, when I was discovering that not all of the promises would be kept, that some things are in fact irrevocable and that it had counted after all, every evasion and ever procrastination, every word, all of it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
That is what it was all about, wasn&#8217;t it? Promises? Now when New York comes back to me it comes in hallucinatory flashes, so clinically detailed that I sometimes wish that memory would effect the distortion with which it is commonly credited. For a lot of the time I was in New York I used a perfume called Fleurs de Rocaille, and then L&#8217;Air du Temps, and now the slightest trace of either can short-circuit my connections for the rest of the day. Nor can I smell Henri Bendel jasmine soap without falling back into the past, or the particular mixture of spices used for boiling crabs. There were barrels of crab boil in a Czech place in the Eighties where I once shopped. Smells, of course, are notorious memory stimuli, but there are other things which affect me the same way. Blue-and-white striped sheets. Vermouth cassis. Some faded nightgowns which were new in 1959 or 1960, and some chiffon scarves I bought about the same time.<br />
<br />
I suppose that a lot of us who have been very young in New York have the same scenes in our home screens. I remember sitting in a lot of apartments with a slight headache about five o&#8217;clock in the morning. I had a friend who could not sleep, and he knew a few other people who had the same trouble, and we would watch the sky lighten and have a last drink with no ice and then go home in the early morning, when the streets were clean and wet (had it rained in the night? we never knew) and the few cruising taxis still had their headlights on and the only color was the red and green of traffic signals. The White Rose bars opened very early in the morning; I recall waiting in one of them to watch an astronaut go into space, waiting so long that at the moment it actually happened I had my eyes not on the television screen but on a cockroach on the tile floor. I liked the bleak branches above Washington Square at dawn, and the monochromatic flatness of Second Avenue, the fire escapes and the grilled storefronts peculiar and empty in their perspective.<br />
<br />
It is relatively hard to fight at six-thirty or seven in the morning, without any sleep, which was perhaps one reason why we stayed up all night, and it seemed to me a pleasant time of day. The windows were shuttered in that apartment in the Nineties and I could sleep for a few hours and then go to work. I could work the on two or three hours&#8217; sleep and a container of coffee from Chock Full O&#8217; Nuts. I liked going to work, liked the soothing and satisfactory rhythm of getting out a magazine, liked the orderly progression of four-color closings and two-color closings and black-and-white closings and then The Product, no abstraction but something which looked effortlessly glossy and could be picked up on a newsstand and weighed in the hand. I liked all the minutiae of proofs and layouts, liked working late on the nights the magazines went to press, sitting and reading Variety and waiting for the copy desk to call. From my office, I could look across town to the weather signal on the Mutual of New York Building and the lights that alternately spelled TIME and LIFE above Rockeffeler Plaza; that pleased me obscurely, and so did walking uptown in the mauve eight o&#8217;clocks of early summer evenings and looking at things, Lowestoft tureens in Fifty-seventh Street windows, people in evening clothes trying to get taxis, the trees just coming into full leaf, the lambent air, all the sweet promises of money and summer.<br />
<br />
Some years passed, but I still did not lose that sense of wonder about New York. I began to cherish the loneliness of it, the sense that at any given time no one need know where I was or what I was doing. I liked walking, from the East River over to the Hudson and back on brisk days, down around the Village on warm days. A friend would leave me the key to her apartment in the West Village when she was out of town, and sometimes I would just move down there, because by that time the telephone was beginning to bother me (the canker, you see, was already in the rose) and not many people had that number. I remember one day when someone who did have the West Village number came to pick me up for lunch there, and we both had hangovers, and I cut my finger opening him a beer and burst into tears, and we walked to a Spanish restaurant and drank bloody Marys and gazpacho until we felt better. I was not then guilt-ridden about spending afternoons that way, because I still had all the afternoons in the world.<br />
<br />
And even that late in the game I still liked going to parties, all parties, bad parties, Saturday-afternoon parties given by recently married couples who lived in Stuyvesant Town, West Side parties given by unpublished or failed writers who served cheap red wine and talked about going to Guatalajara, Village parties where all the guests worked for advertising agencies and voted for Reform Democrats, press parties at Sardi&#8217;s, the worst kind of parties. You will have perceived by now that I was not one to profit by the experience of others, that it was a very long time indeed before I stopped believing in new faces and began to understand the lesson in that story, which was that it is distinctly possible to stay too long at the Fair.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I could not tell you when I began to understand that. All I know is that it was very bad when I was twenty-eight. Everything that was said to me I seemed to have heard before, and I could no longer listen. I could no longer sit in little bars near Grand Central and listen to someone complaining of his wife&#8217;s inability to cope with the help while he missed another train to Connecticut. I no longer had any interest in hearing about the advances other people had received from their publishers, about plays which were having second-act trouble in Philadelphia, or about people I would like very much if only I would come out and meet them. I had already met them, always. There were certain parts of the city which I had to avoid. I could not bear upper Madison Avenue on weekday mornings (this was a particularly inconvenient aversion, since I then lived just fifty or sixty feet east of Madison), because I would see women walking Yorkshire terriers and shopping at Gristede&#8217;s, and some Veblenesque gorge would rise in my throat. I could not go to Times Square in the afternoon, or to the New York Public Library for any reason whatsoever. One day I could not go into a Schrafft&#8217;s; the next it would be the Bonwit Teller.<br />
<br />
I hurt the people I cared about, and insulted those I did not. I cut myself off from the one person who was closer to me than any other. I cried until I was not even aware when I was crying and when I was not, I cried in elevators and in taxis and in Chinese laundries, and when I went to the doctor, he said only that I seemed to be depressed, and that I should see a &#8220;specialist.&#8221; He wrote down a psychiatrist&#8217;s name and address for me, but I did not go.<br />
<br />
Instead I got married, which as it turned out was a very good thing to do but badly timed, since I still could not walk on upper Madison Avenue in the mornings and still could not talk to people and still cried in Chinese laundries. I had never before understood what &#8220;despair&#8221; meant, and I am not sure that I understand now, but I understood that year. Of course I could not work. I could not even get dinner with any degree of certainty, and I would sit in the apartment on Seventy-fifth Street paralyzed until my husband would call from his office and say gently that I did not have to get dinner, that I could meet him at Michael&#8217;s Pub or at Toots Shor&#8217;s or at Sardi&#8217;s East. And then one morning in April (we had been married in January) he called and told me that he wanted to get out of New York for a while, that he would take a six-month leave of absence, that we would go somewhere.<br />
<br />
It was three years ago he told me that, and we have lived in Los Angeles since. Many of the people we knew in New York think this a curious aberration, and in fact tell us so. There is no possible, no adequate answer to that, and so we give certain stock answers, the answers everyone gives. I talk about how difficult it would be for us to &#8220;afford&#8221; to live in New York right now, about how much &#8220;space&#8221; we need, All I mean is that I was very young in New York, and that at some point the golden rhythm was broken, and I am not that young anymore. The last time I was in New York was in a cold January, and everyone was ill and tired. Many of the people I used to know there had moved to Dallas or had gone on Antabuse or had bought a farm in New Hampshire. We stayed ten days, and then we took an afternoon flight back to Los Angeles, and on the way home from the airport that night I could see the moon on the Pacific and smell jasmine all around and we both knew that there was no longer any point in keeping the apartment we still kept in New York. There were years when I called Los Angeles &#8220;the Coast,&#8221; but they seem a long time ago.certain ways an alien place:&nbsp; not the coastal&nbsp; the California ofsubtropical 
    twilights and the soft westerlies off the Pacific but a harsher California, 
    haunted by the Mohave just beyond the mountains, devastated by the hot dry 
    Santa Ana wind that comes down through the passes at 100 miles an hour and 
    whines through the Eucalypts windbreaks and works on the nerves.&nbsp; October is 
    the bad month for the wind, the month when breathing is difficult and the 
    hills blaze up spontaneously. There has been no rain since April.&nbsp; Every 
    voice seems a scream.&nbsp; It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly 
    dread, wherever the wind blows.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mormons settled this ominous country, and then they 
    abandoned it but by the time they left the first orange tree had been 
    planted and for the next hundred years the San Bernardino Valley would draw 
    a kind of people who imagined they might live among the talismanic fruit and 
    prosper in die dry air, people who brought with them Mid-western ways of 
    building and cooking and praying and who tried to graft those ways upon the 
    land.&nbsp; The graft took incurious ways.&nbsp; This is the California where it is 
    possible to live and die without ever eating an artichoke, without ever 
    meeting a Catholic or a Jew.&nbsp; This is the California where it is easy to 
    Dial-A-Devotion, but hard to buy a book.&nbsp; This is the country in which a 
    belief in the literal interpretation of Genesis has slipped imperceptibly 
    into a belief in the literal interpretation of Double Indemnity, the country 
    of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for whom all life's promise 
    comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly 
    or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and return to hairdressers' 
    school.&nbsp; We were just crazy kids they say without regret, and look to the 
    future.&nbsp; The future always looks good in the golden land, because no one 
    remembers the past.&nbsp; Here is where the hot wind blows and the old ways do 
    not seem relevant, where the divorce rate is double the national average and 
    where one person in every thirty-eight lives in a trailer.&nbsp; <br>
    <font size="1">&nbsp;</font><br>
    Here is the last stop for all those who&nbsp; come from somewhere else, for all 
    those who drifted away from the cold and the past and the old ways.&nbsp; Here is 
    where they are trying to find a new life style, trying to find it in the 
    only places they know to look:&nbsp; the movies and the newspapers.&nbsp; The case of 
    Lucille Marie Maxwell Miller is a tabloid monument to that new life style.<br>
    <font size="1">&nbsp;</font><br>
    Imagine Banyan Street first, because Banyan is where it happened. The way to 
    Banyan is to drive west from San Bernardino out Foothill Boulevard, Route 
    66: &nbsp;past the Santa Fe switching yards, the Forty Winks Motel. &nbsp;Past the 
    motel that is nineteen stucco tepees: &nbsp;&quot;SLEEP IN A WIGWAM-GET MORE FOR YOUR 
    WAMPUM.&quot; &nbsp;Past Fontana Drag City and the Fontana Church of the Nazarene and 
    the Pit Stop A Go-Go; past Kaiser Steel, through Cucamonga, out to the Kapu 
    Kai Restaurant-Bar and Coffee Shop, at the corner of Route 66 and Carnelian 
    Avenue. &nbsp;Up Carnelian Avenue from the Kapu Kai, which means &quot;Forbidden 
    Seas,&quot; the subdivision flags whip in the harsh wind.&nbsp; &quot;HALF-ACRE RANCHES!&nbsp; 
    SNACK BARS! TRAVERTINE ENTRIES! &nbsp;$95 DOWN.&quot; &nbsp;It is the trail of an intention 
    gone haywire, the flotsam of the New California.&nbsp; But after awhile the signs 
    thin out on Carnelian Avenue, and the houses are no longer the bright 
    pastels of the Springtime Home owners but the faded bungalows of the people 
    who grow a few grapes and keep a few chickens out here, and then the hill 
    gets steeper and the road climbs and even the bungalows are few, and here 
    desolate, roughly surfaced, lined with eucalyptus and lemon groves---is 
    Banyan Street.<br>
    <font size="1">&nbsp;</font><br>
    Like so much of this country, Banyan suggests something curious and 
    unnatural. The lemon groves are sunken, down a three- or four-foot retaining 
    wall, so that one looks directly into their dense foliage, too lush, 
    unsettlingly &nbsp;glossy, the greenery of nightmare; the fallen eucalyptus bark 
    is too dusty, a place for snakes to breed.&nbsp; The stones look not like natural 
    stones but like the rubble of some unmentioned upheaval.&nbsp; There are smudge 
    pots, and a closed cistern.&nbsp; To one side of Banyan there the flat valley, 
    and to the other the San Bernardino Mountains, a dark mass looming too high, 
    too fist, nine, ten, eleven thousand feet, right there above the lemon 
    groves.&nbsp; At midnight on Banyan Street there is no light at all, and no sound 
    except the wind in the eucalyptus and a muffled barking of dogs.&nbsp; There may 
    be a kennel somewhere, or the dogs may be coyotes.<br>
    <font size="1">&nbsp;</font><br>
    Banyan Street was the route Lucille Miller took home from the twenty-four 
    hour Mayfair Market on the night of October 7, 1969, a night when the moon 
    was dark and the wind was blowing and she was out of milk, and Banyan Street 
    was where, at about 12:30 A.M., her 1964 Volkswagen came to a sudden stop, 
    caught fire, and began to burn.&nbsp; For an hour and fifteen minutes Lucille 
    Miller ran up and down Banyan calling for help, but no cars passed and no 
    help came.&nbsp; At three o'clock that morning, when the fire had been put out 
    and the California Highway Patrol officers were completing their report, 
    Lucille Miller was still sobbing and incoherent, for her husband had been 
    asleep in the Volkswagen.&nbsp; &quot;What will I tell the children, when there's 
    nothing left, nothing left in the casket:' she cried to the friend called to 
    comfort her.&nbsp; &quot;How can I tell them there's nothing left?&quot;<br>
    <font size="1">&nbsp;</font><br>
    In fact there was something left, and a week later it lay in the Draper 
    Mortuary Chapel in a closed bronze coffin blanketed with pink carnations.&nbsp; 
    Some 200 mourners heard Elder Robert E. Denton of the Seventh-Day Adventist 
    Church of Ontario speak of &quot;the temper of fury that has broken out among 
    us.&quot;&nbsp; For Gordon Miller, he said, there would be &quot;no more death, no more 
    heartache, and no more misunderstandings.&quot;&nbsp; Elder Ansel Bristol mentioned 
    the &quot;peculiar&quot; grief of the hour.&nbsp; Elder Fred Jensen asked &quot;what shall it 
    profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&quot;&nbsp; A 
    light rain fell, a blessing in a dry season, and a female vocalist sang 
    &quot;Safe in the Arms of Jesus.&quot;&nbsp; A tape recording of the service was made for 
    the widow, who was being held without bail in the San Bernardino County jail 
    on a charge of first-degree murder.<br>
    <br>
    Of course she came from somewhere else, came off the prairie, in search of 
    something she had seen in a movie or heard on the radio.&nbsp; For this is a 
    Southern California story.&nbsp; She was born on January 17, 1930, in Winnipeg, 
    Manitoba, the only child of Gordon and Lily Maxwell, both school teachers 
    hers and both dedicated to the&nbsp; Seventh-Day Adventist Church whose members 
    observe the Sabbath on Saturday, believe in an apocalyptic Second Coming, 
    have a strong missionary tendency, and, if they are strict, do not smoke, 
    drink, eat meat, use makeup, or wear jewelry, including wedding rings.&nbsp; By 
    the time Lucille Maxwell enrolled at Walla Walla College in College Place, 
    Washington, the Adventist school where her parents then taught, she was an 
    eighteen-year-old possessed of unremarkable good looks and remarkable high 
    spirits.&nbsp; &quot;Lucille wanted to see the world,&quot; her father would say in 
    retrospect, &quot;and I guess she found out.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: -3">The high spirits did not seem to lend themselves to an 
    extended course of study at Walla Walla College and in the spring of 1949 
    Licille-Maxwell met and married Gorgon (&quot;Cork&quot;) Miller, a 
    twenty-four-year-old graduate<u> of </u>Walla Walla and of the University of 
    Oregon dental school, then stationed at Fort Lewis as a medical officer.&nbsp; 
    &quot;Maybe you could say it was love at first sight,&quot; Mr. Maxwell recalls.&nbsp; 
    &quot;Before they were ever formally introduced, he sent Lucille a dozen and a 
    half roses with a card that said even if she didn't come out<u> </u>on a 
    date with him, he hoped she'd find the roses pretty anyway.&quot; The Maxwells 
    remember their daughter as a' &quot;radiant&quot; bride.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Unhappy marriages so resemble 
    one another that we do not need to know too much about the course of this 
    one.&nbsp; There may or may not have been trouble on Guam, where Cork and Lucille 
    Miller lived while he finished his Army duty.&nbsp; There may or may not have 
    been problems in the small Oregon town where he first set up private 
    practice.&nbsp; There appears to have been some disappointment-about their move 
    to California:&nbsp; Cork Miller bad told friends that he wanted to become a 
    doctor, that he was unhappy as a dentist and planned to enter the 
    Seventh-Day Adventist College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda, a few 
    miles south of San Bernardino. Instead he bought a dental practice in the 
    west end of San Bernardino County, and the family settled there, In a modest 
    house on the kind of street where there are always tricycles and revolving 
    credit and dreams about bigger houses, better streets. That was 1957.&nbsp; By 
    the summer of 1964 they had achieved -the bigger house on the better street 
    and the familiar accouterments of a family on its way up: the $30,000 a 
    year, the three children for the Christmas card, the picture window, the 
    family room, the newspaper photographs that showed &quot;Mrs. Gordon Miller, 
    Ontario Heart Fund Chairman.&quot;&nbsp; They were paying the familiar price for it.&nbsp; 
    And they had reached the familiar season of divorce.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It might have been anyones bad summer, anyone's siege 
    of heat and nerves and migraine and money worries, but this one began 
    particularly early and particularly badly.&nbsp; On April 24 an old friend, 
    Elaine Hayton, died suddenly; Lucille Miller had seen her only the night 
    before.&nbsp; During the month of May, Cork Miller was hospitalized briefly with 
    a bleeding ulcer, and his usual reserve deepened into depression.&nbsp; He told 
    his accountant that he was &quot;sick of looking at open mouths and threatened 
    suicide.&nbsp; By July 8, the conventional tensions of love and money had reached 
    the conventional impasse in the new house on the acre lot at 8488 Bella 
    Vista, and Lucille Miller filed for divorce.&nbsp; Within a month, however, the 
    Millers seemed reconciled.&nbsp; They saw a marriage counselor.&nbsp; They talked 
    about a fourth child.&nbsp; It seemed that the marriage had reached the 
    traditional truce, the&nbsp; point at which so many resign themselves to cutting 
    both their losses and their hopes.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">But the Millers' season of trouble was not to end that 
    easily.&nbsp; October 7 began as a commonplace enough day, one of those days that 
    sets the teeth on edge with its tedium, its small frustrations.&nbsp; The 
    temperature reached 102 degrees in San Bernardino that afternoon, and the 
    Miller children were home from school because of Teachers' Institute.&nbsp; There 
    was ironing to be dropped off.&nbsp; There was a trip to pick up a prescription 
    for Nembutal, a trip to a self-service dry cleaner.&nbsp; In the early evening, 
    an unpleasant accident with the Volkswagen:&nbsp; Cork Miller hit and killed a 
    German shepherd, and afterward said that his head felt like it had a Mack 
    truck on it.&nbsp; It was something he often said.&nbsp; As of that evening Cork 
    Miller was $630,479 in debt, including the $29,637 mortgage on the new 
    house, a debt load which seemed oppressive to him.&nbsp; He was a man who wore 
    his responsibilities uneasily, and complained of migraine headaches almost 
    constantly.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">He ate alone that night, from a TV tray in the living 
    room.&nbsp; Later tile Millers watched John Forsythe and Santa Berger in See How 
    They Run, and when the movie ended, about eleven, Cork Miller suggested that 
    they go out for milk.&nbsp; He wanted some hot chocolate. &nbsp;He took a blanket and 
    pillow from the couch and climbed into the passenger seat of the Volkswagen. 
    &nbsp;Lucille Miller remembers reaching over to lock his door as she backed down 
    the driveway.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">By the time she left tile Mayfair Market, and long 
    before they reached Banyan Street, Cork Miller appeared to be asleep.&nbsp; There 
    is some confusion in Lucille Miller's mind about what happened between 12:30 
    A.M., when the fire broke out, and 1:50 A.M., when it was reported.&nbsp; She 
    says that she was driving east on Banyan Street at about 35 m.p.h. when she 
    felt the Volkswagen pull sharply to the right.&nbsp; The next thing she knew the 
    car was on the embankment, quite near the edge of the retaining wall, and 
    flames were shooting up behind her.&nbsp; She does not remember jumping out.&nbsp; She 
    does remember prying up a stone with which she broke the window next to her 
    husband, and then scrambling down the retaining wall to try to find a 
    stick.&nbsp; &quot;I don't know how I was going to push him out,&quot; she says. &quot;I just 
    thought if I had a stick, I'd push him out.&quot;&nbsp; She could not, and after a 
    while she ran to the intersection of Banyan and Carnelian Avenue.&nbsp; There are 
    no houses at that corner, and almost no traffic.&nbsp; After one car had passed 
    without stopping, Lucille Miller ran back down Banyan toward tile burning 
    Volkswagen.&nbsp; She did not stop, but she slowed down, and in the flames she 
    could see her husband.&nbsp; He was, she said, &quot;just black.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the first house up Sapphire Avenue, half 
    a mile from the Volkswagen, Lucille Miller finally found help.&nbsp; There Mrs. 
    Robert Swenson called the sheriff, and then, at Lucille Miller's request, 
    she called Harold Lance, the Millers' lawyer and their close friend.&nbsp; When 
    Harold Lance arrived he took Lucille Miller home to his wife, Joan.&nbsp; Twice 
    Harold Lance and Lucille Miller returned to Banyan Street and talked to the 
    Highway Patrol officers.&nbsp; A third time Harold Lance returned alone, and when 
    he came back he said to Lucille Miller, &quot;O.K....you don't talk any more.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">When Lucille Miller was arrested the next afternoon, 
    Sandy Slagle was with her.&nbsp; Sandy Slagle was the intense, relentlessly loyal 
    medical student who used to baby-sit for the Millers, and bad been living as 
    a member of the family since she graduated from high school in 1959.&nbsp; The 
    Millers took her away from a difficult home situation, and she thinks of 
    Lucille Miller not only as &quot;more or less a mother or a sister&quot; but as &quot;the 
    most wonderful character&quot; she has ever known.&nbsp; On the night of the accident, 
    Sandy Slagle was in her dormitory at Loma Linda University, but Lucille 
    Miller called her early in the morning and asked her to come home.&nbsp; The 
    doctor was there when Sandy Slagle arrived, giving Lucille Miller an 
    injection of Nembutal.&nbsp; &quot;She was crying as she was going under Sandy Slagle 
    recalls. &quot;Over and over she'd say,&nbsp; 'Sandy, all the hours I spent trying to 
    save him and now what are they trying to <i>do</i> to me?&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At 1:30 that afternoon, Sergeant William Paterson and 
    Detectives Charles Callahan and Joseph Karr of the Central Homicide Division 
    arrived at 8488 Bella Vista.&nbsp; &quot;One of them appeared at the bedroom door:&nbsp; 
    Sandy Slagle remembers &quot;and said to Lucille, 'You've got ten minutes to get 
    dressed or we'll take you as you are. She was in her night gown, you know, 
    so I tried to get her dressed.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Sandy Slagle tells the story now as if by rote and her 
    eyes do no waver.&nbsp; &quot;So I had her panties and bra on her and they opened the 
    door again, so I got some Capris on her, you know, and a scarf.&quot; &nbsp;Her voice 
    drops. &nbsp;&quot;And then they just took her.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The arrest took place just twelve hours after the first 
    report that there had been an accident on Banyan Street, a rapidity which 
    would later prompt Lucille Millers attorney to say that the entire case was 
    an instance of trying to justify a reckless arrest. &nbsp;Actually what first 
    caused the detectives who arrived on Banyan Street toward dawn that morning 
    to give the accident more than routine attention were certain apparent 
    physical inconsistencies.&nbsp; While Lucille Miller had said that she was 
    driving about 35 m.p.h. when the car swerved to a stop, an examination of 
    the cooling Volkswagen showed that it was in low gear, and that the parking 
    rather than the driving lights were on.&nbsp; The front wheels, moreover, did not 
    seem to be in exactly the position that Lucille Miller's description of the 
    accident would suggest, and the right rear wheel was dug in deep, as if it 
    had been spun in place.&nbsp; It seemed curious to the detectives, too, that a 
    sudden stop from 35 m.p.h.the same jolt which was presumed to have knocked 
    over a gasoline can in the back seat and somehow started the fireshould 
    have left two milk cartons up right on the back floorboard, and the remains 
    of a Polaroid camera box lying apparently undisturbed on the back seat.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">No one, however, could be expected to give a precise 
    account of what did and did not happen in a moment of terror, and none of 
    these inconsistencies seemed in themselves incontrovertible evidence of 
    criminal intent.&nbsp; But they did interest the Sheriffs Office, as did Gordon 
    Miller's apparent unconsciousness at the time of the accident, and the 
    length of time it had taken Lucille Miller to get help.&nbsp; Something, 
    moreover, struck the investigators as wrong about Harold Lance's attitude 
    when he came back to Banyan Street the third time and found the 
    investigation by no means over.&nbsp; &quot;The way Lance was acting,&quot; the prosecuting 
    attorney said later, &quot;they thought maybe they'd hit a nerve.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">And so it was that on the morning of October 8, even 
    before the doctor had come to give Lucille Miller an injection to calm her, 
    the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Office was trying to construct another 
    version of what might have happened between 12:30 and 1: 50 A.M.&nbsp; The 
    hypothesis they would eventually present was based on the somewhat tortuous 
    premise that Lucille Miller had undertaken a plan which failed: a plan to 
    stop the car on the lonely road, spread gasoline over her presumably drugged 
    husband, and, with a stick on the accelerator, gently &quot;walk&quot; the Volkswagen 
    over the embankment, where it would tumble four feet down the retaining wall 
    into the lemon grove and almost certainly explode.&nbsp; If this happened, 
    Lucille Miller might then have somehow negotiated the two miles up Carnelian 
    to Bella Vista in time to be home when the accident was discovered.&nbsp; This 
    plan went awry, according to the Sheriff's Office hypothesis, when the car 
    would not go over the rise of the embankment.&nbsp; Lucille Miller might have 
    panicked thenafter she had killed the engine the third or fourth time, say, 
    out there on the dark road with the gasoline already spread and the dogs 
    baying and the wind blowing and the unspeakable apprehension that a pair of 
    headlights would suddenly light up Banyan Street and expose her thereand 
    set the fire herself.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Although this version accounted for some of the 
    physical evidence, the car in low because it had been started from a dead 
    stop, the parking lights on because she could not do what needed doing 
    without some light, a rear wheel spun in repeated attempts to get the car 
    over the embankment, the milk cartons upright because there had been no 
    sudden stopit did not seem on its own any more or less credible than 
    Lucille Miller's own story.&nbsp; Moreover, some of the physical evidence did 
    seem to support her story: a nail in a front tire, a nine-pound rock found 
    in the car, presumably the one with which she had broken the window in an 
    attempt to save her husband.&nbsp; Within a few days an autopsy had established 
    that Gordon Miller was alive when he burned, which did not particularly help 
    the State's case, and that he had enough Nembutal and Sandoptal in his blood 
    to put the average person to sleep, which did: on the other hand Gordon 
    Miller habitually took both Nembutal and Fiorinal (a common headache 
    prescription which contains Sandoptal), and had been ill besides.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It was a spotty case, and to make it work at all the 
    State was going to have to find a motive. &nbsp;These was talk of unhappiness, 
    talk of another man.&nbsp; That kind of motive, during the next few weeks, was 
    what they set out to establish.&nbsp; &nbsp;They set out to find it in accountants 
    ledgers and double-indemnity clauses and motel registers, set out to 
    determine what might move a woman who believed in all the promises of&nbsp; the 
    middle classa woman who had been</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">chairman of the Heart Fund and who always knew a 
    reasonable little dressmakerand who had come out of the bleak wild of 
    prairie fundamentalism to find what she imagined to be the good lifewhat 
    would drive such a woman to sit on&nbsp; street called Bella Vista and look out 
    her new picture window into the empty California sun and calculate how to 
    burn her husband alive in a Volkswagen.&nbsp;&nbsp; They found the wedge they wanted 
    closer at hand than they might have at first expected, for, as testimony 
    would reveal later at the trial, it seemed that in December of 1963 Lucille 
    Miller had begun an affair with the husband of one of her friends, a man 
    whose daughter called her &quot;Auntie Lucille,&quot; a man who might have seemed to 
    have the gift for people and money and the good life that Cork Miller so 
    noticeably lacked. &nbsp;The man was Arthwell Hayton, a well-known San Bernardino 
    attorney and at one time a member of the district attorney's staff.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In some ways it was the conventional clandestine affair 
    in a place like San Bernardino, a place where little is bright or graceful, 
    where it is routine to misplace the future and easy to start looking for it 
    in bed.&nbsp; Over the seven weeks that it would take to try Lucille Miller for 
    murder, Assistant District Attorney Don A. Turner and defense Attorney 
    Edward P. Foley would between them unfold a curiously predictable story.&nbsp; 
    There were the falsified motel registrations.&nbsp; There were the lunch dates, 
    the afternoon drives in Arthwell Hayton's red Cadillac convertible.&nbsp; There 
    were the interminable discussions of the wronged partners.&nbsp; There were the 
    confidantes (&quot;I knew everything,&quot; Sandy Slagle would insist fiercely later.&nbsp; 
    &quot;I knew every time, places, everything')&nbsp; and there were the words 
    remembered from bad magazine stories (&quot;Don't kiss me, it will trigger 
    things,&quot; Lucille Miller remembered telling Arthwell Hayton in the parking 
    lot of Harold's Club in Fontana after lunch one day) and there were the 
    notes, the sweet exchanges: &quot;Hi Sweetie Pie!&nbsp; You are my cup of teal!&nbsp; Happy 
    Birthdayyou don't look a day over 29!!&nbsp; Your baby, Arthwell.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">And, toward the end, there was the acrimony.&nbsp; It was 
    April 24, 1964, when Arthwell Hayton's wife, Elaine, died suddenly, and 
    nothing good happened after that.&nbsp; Arthwell Hayton had taken his cruiser, 
    Captains Lady, over to Catalina that weekend; he called home at nine 
    o'clock Friday night, but did not talk to his wife because Lucille Miller 
    answered the telephone and said that Elaine was showering.&nbsp; The next morning 
    the Haytons' daughter found her mother in bed, dead.&nbsp; The newspapers 
    reported the death as accidental, perhaps the result of an allergy to hair 
    spray.&nbsp; When Arthwell Hayton flew home from Catalina that weekend, Lucille 
    Miller met him at the airport, but the finish had already been written.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It was in the breakup that the affair ceased to be in 
    the conventional mode and began to resemble instead the novels of James M. 
    Cain, the movies of the late 30s, all the dreams in which violence and 
    threats and blackmail are made to seem commonplaces of middle-class life. 
    &nbsp;What was most startling about the case the State of California was 
    preparing against Lucille Miller was something that had nothing to do with 
    law at all, something that never appeared in the eight-column afternoon 
    headlines but was always there between them: the revelation that the dream 
    was teaching the dreamers how to live.&nbsp; Here is Lucille Miller talking to 
    her lover sometime in the early summer of 1964, after, he had indicated 
    that, on the advice of his minister, he did not intend to see her any more:&nbsp; 
    &quot;First, I'm going to go to that dear pastor of yours and tell him a few 
    things.... When I do tell him that, you won't be in the Redlands Church any 
    more... Look, Sonny Boy, if you think your reputation is going to be ruined, 
    your life won't be worth two cents.&quot;&nbsp; Here is Arthwell Hayton, to Lucille 
    Miller: &quot;I'll go to Sheriff&nbsp; Frank Bland and tell him some things that I 
    know about you until you'll wish you'd never heard of Arthwell Hayton.'&nbsp; For 
    an affair between a Seventh-Day Adventist dentist's wife and a Seventh-Day 
    Adventist personal-injury lawyer, it seems a curious kind of dialogue.<br>
    <font size="1">&nbsp;</font><br>
    &quot;Boy, I could get that little boy coming and going,&quot; Lucille Miller later 
    confided to Erwin Sprengle, a Riverside contractor who was a business 
    partner of Arthwell Hayton's and a friend to both the lovers. &nbsp;(Friend or 
    no, on this occasion he happened to have an induction coil attached to his 
    telephone in order to tape Lucille Miller's call.) &nbsp;&quot;And he hasn't got one 
    thing on me that he can prove. &nbsp;I mean, I've got concrete has nothing 
    concrete.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the same taped conversation with Erwin Sprengle, Lucille 
    Miller mentioned a tape that she herself had surreptitiously made, months 
    before, in Arthwell Hayton's car.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I said to him, I said 'Arthwell, I just feel like I'm 
    being used!&nbsp; . . He started sucking his thumb and he said I love you. . . . 
    This isn't something that happened yesterday.&nbsp; I'd marry you tomorrow if I 
    could. &nbsp;I don't love Elaine.' He'd love to. hear that played back, wouldn't 
    he?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Yeah:' drawled Sprengle's voice on the tape. &nbsp;&quot;That 
    would be just a little incriminating, wouldn't it?&quot; </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Just a <i>little</i> incriminating,' Lucille Miller 
    agreed.&nbsp; &quot;It really <i>is</i>.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Later on the tape, Sprengle asked where Cork Miller 
    was.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;He took the children down to the church.&quot;<br>
    &quot;You didn't go?&quot; <br>
    No.&quot;<br>
    &quot;You're naughty.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">It was all, moreover, in the name of love; everyone 
    involved placed a magical faith in the efficacy of the very word. &nbsp;There was 
    the significance that Lucille Miller saw in Arthwell's saying that he 
    &quot;loved&quot; her, that he did not &quot;love&quot; Elaine. &nbsp;There was Arthwell insisting, 
    later, at the trial, that he had never said it, that he may have &quot;whispered 
    sweet nothings in her ear&quot; (as her defense hinted that he had whispered in 
    many ears), but he did not remember bestowing upon her the special seal, 
    saying the word, declaring &quot;love.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was the summer evening when 
    Lucille Miller and Sandy Slagle followed Arthwell Hayton down to his new 
    boat in its mooring at Newport Beach and untied the lines with Arthwell 
    aboard, Arthwell and a girl with whom he later testified he was drinking hot 
    chocolate and watching television.&nbsp; I did that on purpose, Lucille Miller 
    told Erwin Sprengle later, &quot;to save myself from letting my heart do 
    something crazy.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">January 11, 1965, was a bright warm day in Southern 
    California, the kind of day when Catalina floats on the Pacific horizon and 
    the air smells of orange blossoms and it is a long way from the bleak and 
    difficult East, a long way from the cold, a long way from the past. &nbsp;A woman 
    in Hollywood staged an all-night sit-in on the hood of her car to prevent 
    repossession by a finance company. &nbsp;A seventy-year-old pensioner drove his 
    station wagon at five miles an hour past three Gardena poker parlors and 
    emptied three pistols and a twelve-gauge shotgun through their windows, 
    wounding twenty-nine people. &nbsp;&quot;Many young women become prostitutes just to 
    have enough money to play cards,&quot; he explained in a note. &nbsp;Mrs. Nick Adams 
    said that she was &quot;not surprised&quot; to hear her husband announce his divorce 
    plans on the Les Crane Show, and, farther north, a sixteen-year-old jumped 
    off the Golden Gate Bridge and lived.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">And, in the San Bernardino County Courthouse, the 
    Miller trial opened.&nbsp; The crowds were so bad that the glass courtroom doors 
    were shattered in the crush, and from then on identification disks were 
    issued to the first forty-three spectators in line. &nbsp;The line began forming 
    at 6 A.m., and college girls camped at the courthouse all night, with stores 
    of graham crackers and No-Cal.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">All they were doing was picking a jury, those first few 
    days, but the sensational nature of the case had already suggested itself. 
    &nbsp;Early in December there had been an abortive first trial, a trial at which 
    no evidence was ever presented because on the day the jury was seated the 
    San Bernardino <i>Sun-Telegram</i> ran an &quot;inside&quot; story quoting Assistant 
    District Attorney Don Turner, the prosecutor, as saying, &quot;We are looking 
    into the circumstances of Mrs. Hayton's death. &nbsp;In view of the current trial 
    concerning the death of Dr. Miller, I do not feel I should comment on Mrs. 
    Hayton's death.&quot; &nbsp;It seemed that there had been barbiturates in Elaine 
    Hayton's blood, and there had seemed some irregularity about the way she was 
    dressed on that morning when she was found under the covers, dead. Any 
    doubts about the death at the time, however, had never gotten as far as the 
    Sheriff's Office. &nbsp;&quot;I guess somebody didn't want to rock the boat,&quot; Turner 
    said later. &nbsp;These were prominent, people.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Although all of that had not been in the <i>
    Sun-Telegrams</i> story, an immediate mistrial had been declared. &nbsp;Almost 
    as immediately, there had been another development: Arthwell Hayton had 
    asked newspapermen to an 11 A.M. Sunday morning press conference in his 
    office. &nbsp;There had been television cameras, and flash bulbs popping. &nbsp;&quot;As 
    you gentlemen may know,&quot; Hayton had said, striking a note of stiff bonhomie, 
    &quot;there are very often women who become amorous toward their doctor or 
    lawyer. This does not mean on the physician's or lawyers part that there is 
    any romance toward the patient or client.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Would you 
    deny that you were having an affair with Mrs. Miller?&quot; a reporter had asked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I would deny 
    that there was any romance on my part whatsoever.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    It was a distinction he would maintain through all the wearing weeks to 
    come.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;So they had come to see Arthwell, these crowds who now 
    milled beneath the dusty palm outside the courthouse, and they had also come 
    to see Lucille, who appeared as a slight, intermittently pretty woman, 
    already pale from lack of sun, a woman who would turn thirty-five before the 
    trial was over and whose tendency toward haggardness was beginning to show. 
    a meticulous woman who insisted against her lawyer's advice, on coming to 
    court with her hair piled high and lacquered.&nbsp; I would've been happy if 
    she'd come in with it hinging loose, but Lucille wouldn't do that, her 
    lawyer said. &nbsp;He was Edward P. Foley, a small, emotional Irish Catholic who 
    several times wept in the courtroom.&nbsp; She his a great honesty, this woman, 
    he added, but this honesty about her appearance always worked against her.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;By the time the trial opened, Lucille Miller's 
    appearance included maternity clothes, for an official examination on 
    December 18 had revealed that she was then three and a half months pregnant, 
    a fact which made picking a jury even more difficult than usual, for Turner 
    was asking the death penalty. &nbsp;&quot;It's unfortunate but there it is,&quot; he would 
    say of the pregnancy to each juror in turn, and finally twelve were seated, 
    seven of them women, the youngest forty-one, an assembly of the he very 
    peershousewives, a machinist, a truck driver, a grocery-store manager, a 
    filing clerkabove whom Lucille Miller had wanted so badly to rise.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;That was the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sin more than the adultery, which 
    tended to reinforce the one for which she was being tried.&nbsp; It was implicit 
    in booth the defense and the prosecution that Lucille Miller was an erring 
    woman, a woman who perhaps wanted too much. &nbsp;But to the prosecution she was 
    not merely a woman who would want a new house and want to go to parties and 
    run up high telephone bills ($1152 in two months), but a woman who would go 
    so far as to murder her husband for his $80,000 in insurance, making it 
    appear an accident in order to collect another $40,000 in double indemnity 
    and straight accident policies. &nbsp;To Turner she was a woman who did not want 
    simply her freedom and a reasonable alimony (she could have had that, the 
    defense contended, by going through with her divorce suit), but wanted 
    everything, a woman motivated by &quot;love and greed.&quot; &nbsp;She was a &quot;manipulator.&quot; 
    &nbsp;She was a user of people.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;To Edward Foley, on the other hand, she was an 
    impulsive woman who &quot;couldn't control her foolish little heart.&quot; &nbsp;Where 
    Turner skirted the pregnancy, Foley dwelt upon it, even calling the dead 
    man's mother down from Washington to testify that her son had told her they 
    were going to have another baby because Lucille felt that it would &quot;do much 
    to weld our home again in the pleasant relations that we used to have.&quot; 
    &nbsp;Where the prosecution saw a &quot;calculator,&quot; the defense saw a &quot;blabbermouth,&quot; 
    and in fact Lucille Miller did emerge as an ingenuous conversationalist.&nbsp; 
    Just as, before her husband's death, she had confided in her friends about 
    her love affair, so she chatted about it after his death, with the arresting 
    sergeant. &nbsp;&quot;Of course Cork lived with it for years, you know,&quot; her voice was 
    heard to tell Sergeant Paterson on a tape made the morning after her arrest. 
    &nbsp;&quot;After Elaine died, he pushed the panic button one night and just asked me 
    right out, and that, I&nbsp; think, was when he reallythe first time he really 
    faced it.&quot; &nbsp;When the sergeant asked why she had agreed to talk to him, 
    against the specific instructions of her lawyers, Lucille Miller said 
    airily, &quot;Oh, I've always been basically quite an honest person. . . . I mean 
    I can put a hat in the cupboard and say it cost ten dollars less, but 
    basically I've always kind of just lived my life the way I wanted to, and if 
    you don't like it you can take off.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The prosecution hinted at men other than Arthwell, and 
    even, over Foley's objections, managed to name one. &nbsp;The defense called 
    Miller suicidal. &nbsp;The prosecution produced experts who said that the 
    Volkswagen fire could not have been accidental. &nbsp;Foley produced witnesses 
    who said that it could have been. &nbsp;Lucille's father, now a 
    junior-high-school teacher in Oregon, quoted Isaiah to reporters<i>: &quot;Every 
    tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.&quot; </i>
    &nbsp;&quot;Lucille did wrong, her affair,&quot; her mother said judiciously. &nbsp;&quot;With her it 
    was love. &nbsp;But with some I guess it's just passion.&quot; &nbsp;There was Debbie, the 
    Millers' fourteen-year-old, testifying in a steady voice about how she and 
    her mother had gone to a supermarket to buy the gasoline can the week before 
    the accident. &nbsp;There was Sandy Slagle, in the courtroom every day, declaring 
    that on at least one occasion Lucille Miller had prevented her husband not 
    only from committing suicide but from committing suicide in such a way that 
    it would appear an accident and ensure the double-indemnity payment. &nbsp;There 
    was Wenche Berg, the pretty twenty-seven-year-old Norwegian governess to 
    Arthwell Hayton's children, testifying that Arthwell had instructed her not 
    to allow Lucille Miller to see or talk to the children.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Two months dragged by, and the headlines never 
    stopped.&nbsp; Southern California's crime reporters were headquartered in San 
    Bernardino for the duration: Howard Hertel from the <i>Time</i>, Jim Bennett 
    and Eddy Jo Bernal from the <i>Herald</i>-<i>Examiner</i>.&nbsp; Two months in 
    which the Miller trial was pushed off the <i>Examiner</i> front page only by 
    the Academy Award nominations and Stan Laurel's death.&nbsp; And finally, on 
    March 2, after Turner had reiterated that it was a case of &quot;love and greed,&quot; 
    and Foley had protested that his client was being tried for adultery, the 
    case went to the jury.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;They brought in the verdict, guilty of murder in the 
    first degree, at 4:50 P.m. on March 5.&nbsp; &quot;She didn't do it,&quot; Debbie Miller 
    cried, jumping up from the spectators' section.&nbsp; &quot;She didn't do it.&quot;&nbsp; Sandy 
    Slagle collapsed in her seat and began to scream.&nbsp; &quot;Sandy, for God's sake 
    please dont,&quot; Lucille Miller said in a voice that carried across the 
    courtroom, and Sandy Slagle was momentarily subdued.&nbsp; But as the jurors left 
    the courtroom she screamed again: &quot;You're murderers. . . . Every last one of 
    you is a murderer.&quot;&nbsp; Sheriff's deputies moved in then, each wearing a string 
    tie that read &quot;1965 SHERIFF'S RODEO,&quot; and Lucille Miller's father, that 
    sad-faced junior-high-school teacher who believed in the word of Christ and 
    the dangers of wanting to see the world, blew her a kiss off his fingertips.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The California Institution for Women at Frontera, 
    where Lucille Miller is now, lies down where Euclid Avenue turns into 
    country road, not too many miles from where she once lived and shopped and 
    organized the Heart Fund Ball.&nbsp; Cattle graze across the road, and Rainbirds 
    sprinkle the alfalfa.&nbsp; Frontera has a softball field and tennis courts, and 
    looks as if it might be a California junior college, except that the trees 
    are not yet high enough to conceal the concertina wire around the top of the 
    Cyclone fence.&nbsp; On visitors' day there are big cars in the parking area, big 
    Buicks and Pontiacs that belong to grandparents and sisters and fathers (not 
    many of them belong to husbands), and some of them have bumper stickers that 
    say &quot;SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL POLICE.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;A lot of California murderesses live here, a lot of 
    girls who somehow misunderstood the promise.&nbsp; Don Turner put Sandra Garner 
    here (and her husband in the gas chamber at San Quentin) after the 1959 
    desert killings known to crime reporters as &quot;the soda pop murders.&quot;&nbsp; Carole 
    Tregoff is here, and has been ever since she was convicted of conspiring to 
    murder Dr. Finch's wife in West Covina, which is not too far from San 
    Bernardino.&nbsp; Carole Tregoff is in fact a nurse's aide in the prison 
    hospital, and might have attended Lucille Miller had her baby been born at 
    Frontera; Lucille Miller chose instead to have it outside, and paid for the 
    guard who stood outside the delivery room in St. Bernadines Hospital.&nbsp; 
    Debbie Miller came to take the baby home from the hospital, in a white dress 
    with pink ribbons, and Debbie was allowed to choose a name.&nbsp; She named the 
    baby Kimi Kai.&nbsp; The children live with Harold and Joan Lance now, because 
    Lucille Miller will probably spend ten years at Frontera.&nbsp; Don Turner waived 
    his original request for the death penalty (it was generally agreed that he 
    had demanded it only, in Edward Foley's words, &quot;to get anybody with the 
    slightest trace of human kindness in their veins off the jury&quot;), and settled 
    for life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.&nbsp; Lucille Miller does 
    not like it at Frontera, and has had trouble adjusting.&nbsp; &quot;She's going to 
    have to learn humility;' Turner says.&nbsp; &quot;She's going to have to use her 
    ability to charm, to manipulate.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The new house is empty now, the house on the street 
    with the sign that says</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>PRIVATE 
    ROAD<br>
    BELLA VISTA<br>
    DEAD END</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Millers never did get it landscaped, and weeds grow 
    up around the field. stone siding.&nbsp; The television aerial has toppled on the 
    roof, and a trash can is stuffed with the debris of family lifea cheap 
    suitcase, a childs game called Lie Detector.&nbsp; There is a sign on what 
    would have been the lawn, and the sign reads ESTATE SALE. &nbsp;Edward Foley is 
    trying to get Lucille Miller's case appealed, but there have been delays. &quot;A 
    trial always comes down to a matter of sympathy, Foley says wearily now.&nbsp; I 
    couldn't create sympathy for her. &nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is a little weary now, weary 
    and resigned, everyone except Sandy Slagle, whose bitterness is still raw. 
    &nbsp;She lives in an apartment near the medical school in Loma Linda, and 
    studies reports of the case in True Police Cases and Official Detective 
    Stories. &nbsp;&quot;I'd much rather we not talk about the Hayton business too much,&quot;' 
    she tells visitors, and she keeps a tape recorder running.&nbsp; &quot;1d rather talk 
    about Lucille and what a wonderful person she is and how her rights were 
    violated.&quot; &nbsp;Harold Lance does not talk to visitors at all. &nbsp;&quot;We don't want 
    to give away what we can sell, he explains pleasantly; an attempt was made 
    to sell Lucille Millers personal story to <i>Life</i>, but <i>Life</i> did 
    not want to buy it.&nbsp; In the district attorney's offices they are prosecuting 
    other murders now, and do not see why the Miller trial attracted so much 
    attention. &nbsp;&quot;It wasnt a very interesting murder as murders go,&quot; Don Turner 
    says laconically. &nbsp;Elaine Hayton's death is no longer under investigation. 
    &nbsp;&quot;We know everything we want to know, Turner says.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Arthwell Hayton's office is directly below Edward 
    Foleys. &nbsp;Some people around San Bernardino say that Arthwell Hayton 
    suffered; others say that he did not suffer at all. &nbsp;Perhaps he did not, for 
    time past is not believed to have any bearing upon time present or future, 
    out in the golden land where every day the world is born anew. &nbsp;In any case, 
    on October 17, 1965, Arthwell Hayton married again, married his childrens 
    pretty governess, Wenche Berg, at a service in the Chapel of the Roses at a 
    retirement village near Riverside. Later the newlyweds were feted at a 
    reception for seventy-five in the dining room of Rose Garden Village. &nbsp;The 
    bridegroom was in black tie, with a white carnation in his buttonhole. &nbsp;The 
    bride wore a long white <i>peau de soie</i> dress and carried a shower 
    bouquet of sweetheart roses with stephanotis streamers. &nbsp;A coronet of seed 
    pearls held her illusion veil.</p>
